</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<hr class="tiny">
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> publishers claim with no little satisfaction
that in this book they offer the reading public a
genuine novelty. The idea of a novel written by
twenty-four popular writers is certainly an original
one. The ladies and gentlemen who have written
“The Fate of Fenella” have done their work
quite independently of each other. There has
been collaboration but not consultation. As each
one wrote a chapter it was passed on to the next,
and so on until it reached the hands of Mr. F.
Anstey, whose peculiar and delightful humor
made him a fitting choice for bringing the story
to a satisfactory close.</p>

<hr class="tiny">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br>

BY HELEN MATHERS.<br>
<br>
<small>“FENELLA.”</small></h2>

<div class="verse">How we changed the rings frae our fingers,</div>
<div class="indent">And I can show thee thine?</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Her</span> hair, gloves, and shoes were tan-color, and
closely allied to tan, too, was the tawny, true
tiger tint of her hazel eyes. For the rest, she
was entirely white save for her dark lashes and
brows, the faint tint of rose in her small cheeks,
and a deeper red in her lips that were parted just
then in a spasm of silent, delighted mirth. She
stood on the top steps of the Prospect Hotel,
Harrogate, waiting for the coach to come round,
and looking across the hotel gardens to the
picturesque Stray beyond, upon which a unique
game of cricket was just then going forward, to
the intense diversion of all beholders. Two little
boys had evidently started it on their own hook,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
and a variety of casuals had dropped in to bear a
hand, the most distinguished of these being a
nigger minstrel, who, in full war-paint, and with
deep lace ruffles falling over his sooty hands, was
showing all his white teeth, and batting with a
prowess that kept the whole field in action.</p>

<p>“I hope Ronny won’t get his pate cracked,”
said the girl, half aloud, as the four grays drew
up with a flourish, and the usual bustle on the
steps began. “Good-morning, George!” and
she nodded brightly to the good-looking driver,
who beamed all over, and touched his hat, for the
girl had clambered to many a pleasant drive beside
him during the past fortnight.</p>

<p>“Box-seat again!” snapped a spiteful female
voice behind her. “I <i>wonder</i> she is allowed to
monopolize the best seat as she does, day after
day!”</p>

<p>The girl laughed, as, giving a brief glimpse of a
soft mass of whiteness above silken hose, she
swung lightly up to the perch that was indeed
wide enough to accommodate three persons,
though the privilege of occupying the third lay
entirely within George’s jurisdiction, and was
never, save to an old favorite, accorded.</p>

<p>“Where are we going to-day?” she said, as she
settled herself comfortably, and unfurled a big
tan-color sunshade. “Not to any of those tiresome
show-places, I hope? I’m so tired of
them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“No, miss,” said George, who refused, even in
the teeth of Ronny, to recognize her as anything
but a slip of a girl, “we’re going for a drive of
my own; just dawdling about a bit like, and nowhere
in particular.”</p>

<p>“Jolly!” she said, sniffing up the pure air as if
she loved it, and with that delightful quality of
enjoyment in her voice which acts like an elixir
on surrounding company. “Do you know, I
mean to come up here every year to drink the
waters, for I’ve got to <i>love</i> the place!”</p>

<p>George looked delighted as he glanced round
to see if all his cargo was aboard, but as usual
everyone was waiting for the inevitable person
who is <i>always</i> late, and who will probably be
late for his own funeral if he can possibly
manage it.</p>

<p>“Most people who come here once, come again,
miss,” said George, twisting the lash of his whip
into a knot. “There’s one gentleman who never
misses a season, and I was going to ask you, as
a favor, if you’d mind his coming on the box-seat
this morning? He ’most always had it last year.
I told him I must ask a lady’s consent, so we’re
to pick him up outside the Pump-room if you’re
quite agreeable.”</p>

<p>“Is he fat?” said the girl dubiously, and feeling
that her drive would be quite spoiled.</p>

<p>“He’s as slight as a poplar,” said George, his
face lightening up, “and he’s a gentleman, miss,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
and you can’t say more than that. There’s so few
of ’em about nowadays!”</p>

<p>The cargo was now complete. The miscellaneous
crowd that daily assembled to witness the
departure of the coach fell back, the horses
stretched out into a gallop, and skirting the hotel
garden, with its lounging seats, and cheerful
awnings, rounded the corner with a flourish,
emerging on the Stray with a musical horn-blowing
that made Ronny, in the distance, hold up his
little flushed face to his mother, and wave the bat
he was so very seldom allowed to use.</p>

<p>The girl waved and kissed her hand lovingly to
the boy, and the nigger appropriating the compliment
to himself, and promptly returning the
same, while he also tried to combine business and
pleasure by hitting a ball, lost his balance, and
sat down in a large puddle. Quaint and varied
were the aspects of life afforded by the Stray,
that curious piece of ground secured to the townspeople
forever, that in some parts almost resembles
a fair; while in others, ancient trees shut in
stately houses that have all the dignity and peace
of a cathedral close.</p>

<p>In the open a band was playing, nigger minstrels
were performing, children played, old maids
cackled, pigeons flocked, fortune-tellers plied their
craft, and old couples sat side by side like puffins,
warming themselves in the sun. Even in this
inevitable groaning Salvation Army lasses and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
lads were there, combining piety and wealth with
that astuteness which is so distinguishing a feature
of their peculiar religion.</p>

<p>And the thoroughly English scene, so full of
human life, and steeped through and through with
such a glory of September air and sunshine as even
summer had not dared to promise, or even tried
to fulfill, gave extraordinary pleasure to the heart,
making one feel, with Lucretius, that “he who has
grown weary of remaining at home often goes forth,
and suddenly returns, inasmuch as he perceived
he is nothing better for being abroad.”</p>

<p>Down the steep incline in George’s smartest
style, past the Crown Hotel, that should surely
be at the top of the hill, not the bottom, and so
to the Pump-room, where with a clash and a clatter
he draws up, scanning the crowd of people, who,
having drunk their nauseous doses inside, are
dawdling and gossiping in true Harrogate fashion
before they disperse.</p>

<p>The girl does not take the trouble to look at
any of them, not even when George touches his
hat, and says, “Here, my lord.” Then there is
the sensation as of a person ascending the coach,
on <i>her</i> side, she indignantly notes, so that she
hastily whispers:</p>

<p>“Couldn’t he go on your other side, George?”</p>

<p>“Very sorry, miss, but couldn’t drive that
way,” and then she draws her skirts close to
her with head turned aside, as her unwelcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
coach-fellow swings himself into the seat beside
her.</p>

<p>She is so slight, so small, that after all there is
ample room and to spare, especially as he answers
to the graceful description of him furnished by
the driver.</p>

<p>“Do you call this a new drive?” she says
to George, as they rattle past the lovely Bogs
Valley Gardens, and up the steep ascent to the
Spa. “Why——”</p>

<p>“<i>Fenella!</i>” breathlessly exclaimed a voice beside
her.</p>

<p>“<i>Frank.</i>”</p>

<p>Two aghast, petrified young faces looked into
each other; then the girl, recovering herself first,
said:</p>

<p>“Pray, how do <i>you</i> come here?”</p>

<p>“And what brings you?” he retorted.</p>

<p>“Gout. What are you laughing at?” she said
airily; “haven’t I got ancestors? Didn’t they
drink October ale by the hogshead, and old port
by the gallon? And <i>I’ve</i> got to pay the piper,
for I never heard of the liquor hurting <i>them</i>. But
talking of ancestors, I’ve got such a lovely story
to tell you. There is a frightfully fat, vulgar
woman at our hotel, and you know there are only
two things in this sinful world that give me real fits—humbug
and vulgarity. Well, this woman never
for one single meal lets anybody forget her progenitors,
and bawls out at the top of her dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
voice, ‘<i>All</i> my people are cavalry people!’ And
what do you think? Her uncle keeps a pork
shop not far from here, so after all she’s perfectly
right in her boast, only the cavalry are—Pigs!”</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>“You are as bad as ever, I see,” he said, and
then glanced at the driver, who had averted his
head as much as possible.</p>

<p>“George,” said Fenella, putting a coaxing little
face round his shoulder, “could you—<i>would</i> you
mind putting a bit of cotton wool in your ear on
this side, because I want to talk to—to Lord
Francis? I’ve got a bit in my pocket somewhere,
I know.”</p>

<p>George’s face flickered, as he expressed himself
quite agreeable, but was rather surprised, as blue-blooded
people usually talk before their inferiors
as if they had no more hearing and understanding
faculties than tables or chairs. When the
wool was produced out of a smart little pocket,
he proceeded to plug his ear gravely, and even
rammed it down hard to show that his intentions
were strictly honorable. This business over, Fenella
turned round and showed a little laughing
face that seemed to have caught all the sunshine
of the day, aye, and held it fast.</p>

<p>“I always carry a bit in my pocket for Ronny,”
she said, “as he gets a touch of earache sometimes.
What’s that? They can hear us behind?
Oh? no, the trot of the horses’ feet swallows up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
our voices. Let them talk. They will say I
picked you up!”</p>

<p>“So you did. Do you know any of them?”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid! A woman, my dear, who
<i>never</i> sits in the drawing room with the other
ladies,” said Fenella, adroitly mimicking a sour
female voice, “there <i>must</i> be something wrong
about her. And so there is,” she added, below
her breath, and for a moment the little face grew
hard.</p>

<p>“How is Ronny?” said Frank.</p>

<p>“He is very well,” she said nonchalantly.
“Poor wee man, isn’t it a good job he isn’t a girl?
And he hasn’t begun to grow ugly and horrid
and masculine yet—he is all mine, mine!”</p>

<p>The mother’s love in her rang out triumphantly,
and her face grew very tender.</p>

<p>“We have such good times together, he and
I,” she went on happily; “he is not with me to-day,
because he is playing cricket at the present
moment. We go down to the Stray with the bat
and stumps, and forage round for a scratch team.
I took a hand myself the other day, and actually
bowled out a butcher’s boy!”</p>

<p>Frank laughed, then shook his head. “You
are quite as mad as ever,” he said. “Where is
your companion?”</p>

<p>“I <i>hope</i>,” said Fenella calmly, “that she is
dead. I didn’t try to polish off any of the other
ones, because they meant well in spite of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
aggravatingness, but she was downright <i>wicked</i>.
So I led her a life,” she concluded, looking as triumphantly
happy as a child who plays truant on
a glorious day with a pocketful of pennies and
burnt almonds.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Why won’t you be good, Fenella?” he said.
“You could be so easily.”</p>

<p>“I always am,” said Fenella promptly, and
nodded her curly head close to his nose. “I
take sulphur baths, and regularly <i>sneeze</i> sulphur.
I get up every morning at half-past seven. Just
think of that! It’s a fearful scramble, because
Ronny never will wake up. He sleeps just like
you, for ever and ever.” She stopped, and colored
vividly, then dashed on again breathlessly,
“And of course it takes some time to dress him.”</p>

<p>“You have no nurse, no maid!” he exclaimed,
in amazement.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied with great <i>sangfroid</i>, “I
like a free hand, and no woman can have that,
with a female detective tripping up her heels,
and wearing her silk stockings. And I love to
wait on Ronny—to wash and dress him, and make
him look sweet. Of course,” she added anxiously,
“he isn’t <i>always</i> clean—the dirtier a boy is, the
nicer he is—but he is <i>perfectly</i> happy! You
should see us run down the hill to the Pump-room,
though everyone has done long before we
get there! And then we eat <i>such</i> a breakfast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
We’ve got a dear little fat waiter who simply
devotes himself to us, and steals for us all the
newest eggs! But he had an awful accident yesterday,”
said Fenella, turning tragic eyes on
Frank, “what do you think it was?”</p>

<p>“He fell in love with you?”</p>

<p>Fenella began to laugh in that low gurgle
which was so like the sound of a cheerful, over-full
brook.</p>

<p>“Do you remember you said that about my
hairdresser? And how I said I thought it would
really have come cheaper in the end if I <i>had</i> married
him? I always thought that rather neat myself.
But I never told you what the accident was.
He broke four hundred plates yesterday!”</p>

<p>“Very greedy of him if he did it all at once.”</p>

<p>“It <i>was</i> all at once. The strap of the lift
broke as he was hauling them up!”</p>

<p>“Poor devil!” said Frank absently.</p>

<p>They were quite away from the houses now,
and the brisk, pure air, the pleasant scents from
the hedgerows, and the swift movement to the
music of the horses’ feet, and perhaps some other
sources of satisfaction within, brought a light to
Fenella’s eyes, and a rose-soft color to her cheek
that made her altogether enchanting and sweet.</p>

<p>“And pray,” said Frank, looking at her eagerly,
unwillingly, as at forbidden fruit that sorely
tempted him, “do you <i>talk</i> to any of the fellows
at the hotel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“No,” she said airily, “they talk to me. You
see, they are all so fond of Ronny.”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” said Frank, curtly and significantly.</p>

<p>“But I pretend not to hear. Stay—there is
<i>one</i> man whom I talk to——”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” said Frank grimly, and looking
straight between the horses’ ears.</p>

<p>“Oh, nobody in particular,” said Fenella, rather
faintly, “but you see he has a small nephew here,
and it seems he and Ronny met at the Grandisons’
in the country, and are quite old friends.
So the barrister and I have got quite pally.”</p>

<p>Frank sat mute as a fish.</p>

<p>“He is of the type I rather admire,” she said,
with a suspicious note in her voice. “You know,
Frank,” she lifted a naïvely impudent, grave little
face to his, “I always <i>did</i> like a dark, clean-shaven
man!”</p>

<p>Frank himself was as dark and clean-shaven
as it was possible to be, and the corners of his
mouth trembled at her audacity, as he turned
away.</p>

<p>“He told me such a delicious story yesterday,”
she went on, her face breaking up into dimples.
“It was about a little girl upon whose mother a
horrid old woman was calling. When the old
woman got up to depart, she said to the child,
‘You’ll come and see me, my dear, won’t you?’
‘Oh, yes!’ said the child, ‘But you don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
where I live?’ ‘Yes, I do,’ said the child, nodding.
‘I know who is your next-door neighbor.’
‘Who is that?’ says the old woman. ‘Why,
<i>mother</i> says you are next door to a fool!’”</p>

<p>But Frank did not smile. It is curious that a
man’s sense of humor is usually entirely in abeyance
when matters of stern import engross him,
while a woman’s is usually at its keenest when
tragedy is in the air.</p>

<p>“What do people think at the hotel?” he
burst out in the undertone both had maintained
throughout the conversation.</p>

<p>“That I am a widow,” she said coolly; “that
is to say, if they turn up the hotel list of visitors.”</p>

<p>“What name have you inscribed?” he said
coldly.</p>

<p>“Fenella Ffrench. I suppose I have a right
to my own name?”</p>

<p>“And the child’s?”</p>

<p>“Ronny Onslow.”</p>

<p>“What are your trustees about?” he broke
out, with subdued passion.</p>

<p>Fenella shrugged her slender shoulders, and
laughed. “I was twenty-four years old yesterday,”
she said, with apparent irrelevance; “did
you remember?”</p>

<p>“I remembered,” he said curtly.</p>

<p>“Talking of trustees,” she said, “will you ever
forget the talk, and fuss, and documents that day
at Carlton House Terrace? I couldn’t help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
thinking of Lady Caroline Lamb, and how, when
she and her husband were required to sign the
deed of separation, the pair of them could nowhere
be found! When discovered at last, Lady
Caroline was on her husband’s knee, feeding him
with bread and butter! But, though they parted,
he loved her all the time,” went on Fenella, the
little mocking voice grown suddenly wistful;
“and it was on <i>his</i> faithful breast that she pillowed
her dying head at last, and his kind voice
that sped her on her way!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frank, in a strained voice; “her
faults were more of head than heart. But some
women have not even hearts for faults to be bred
in. Why did you do it?” he said suddenly, with
a mist before his own eyes that hindered him
from seeing the tears in hers.</p>

<p>“Hi! Onslow! I say, <i>Onslow</i>!” shouted a
voice that seemed to come from beneath the
horses’ feet, and both the young people peeped
over to see a fat little man in white linen clothes,
standing on tiptoe on the road, and blowing out
his cheeks like a cherub’s.</p>

<p>“Why, Castleton!” cried Frank, “what are
you doing there?”</p>

<p>“Walking down my fat, dear boy. I was looking
heavenward, and saw you coming. Where
do you hang out? Beastly water, rotten eggs,
rusty iron, and a dash of old Nick. Oh, I say!”
(catching sight of Fenella, not quite hidden by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
her sunshade) “is that really—well, you know,
really—I <i>am</i> astonished—and delighted, <i>too</i>! I
always said——”</p>

<p>“Drive on!” roared Frank, and on they went
upon the instant, and Frank turned to look at
Fenella. She was very pale, and very angry, with
all the summer gladness gone out of her eyes and
lips.</p>

<p>“Frank,” she said, “never, <i>never</i> will I submit
to be made ridiculous. By to-morrow this time,
the story will be all over the London clubs. Drive
back to Harrogate with you I will not, and either
you get down, or I will.”</p>

<p>Frank never moved.</p>

<p>“George!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>

<p>She stamped her little foot.</p>

<p>“How dare you call me that?” she said, in a
furious underbreath. “Put me down!”</p>

<p>George never budged an inch. The trot-trot
of the horses’ feet maddened her, and she sprang
up.</p>

<p>“Fenella,” said Frank, winding his arm round
her waist, “if you don’t sit tight, I’ll put you on
my knee, and keep you there, and then I’ll <i>kiss</i>
you.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hulloa</span>, Jacynth!”</p>

<p>Jacynth awoke from his reverie with a start
and stared at the speaker. He had quite forgotten
where he was. Through the gray smoke
of his cigarette he had conjured, as from some
magic vapor, an enchanting face—a girl’s face—with
hazel eyes and wonderful tan-colored hair.
He had been in dreamland, and now he was only
in the gardens of the hotel, and instead of his exquisite
vision he found facing him a fat little man
in white linen, who looked very hot and very
jolly.</p>

<p>“I say, Jacynth, don’t you remember me?”</p>

<p>Jacynth did not remember, at least fully. He
had a dim consciousness that the fat little figure
ought to be familiar to him, but he could not remember
where or why. He had not quite collected
himself yet, and he was slightly annoyed at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
interruption to his day-dream. Also he was
annoyed at being annoyed and being discomposed
by anything. No perplexing witness, no hostile
counsel, no antagonistic judge had ever been
known to ruffle Clitheroe Jacynth’s imperturbability.
But then no vision with tan-colored hair
and hazel eyes had ever come into court with him.
He looked at the fat white figure, and shook his
head gravely.</p>

<p>“But I say, hang it all, Jacynth, don’t you remember
that night in Cairo, and the dancing girls
and the hasheesh den, and the row and all the
rest of it?”</p>

<p>Memory asserted herself in Jacynth’s mind.
He did remember a night in Cairo when a party
of young fellows from Shepheard’s set out to see
something of the queer Cairene slums. The fat
little man was of the party; he was in white then,
too, Jacynth remembered. He remembered, too,
how hugely the little man had enjoyed everything,
from the—well, the eccentricities of the
dancing girls to the fumes in the hasheesh den,
and even to the final scrimmage in the gambling
hell, when Jacynth by a timely stroke saved his
fat companion from being knifed by a Levantine
rogue who had been detected in cheating. There
was an awful row afterward; he remembered
that, too, and an awkward business before the
authorities next morning, but the names of his
friends and his own legal reputation settled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
matter. Yes, he remembered the fat little man
now. He got up with a smile on his dark, clean-shaven
face and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“How are you, Lord Castleton?”</p>

<p>Lord Castleton laughed. That was his way.
He went through life laughing, as if everything
were the best joke in the world.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you haven’t forgotten me,” he
said. “By Jove! I haven’t forgotten you, and
that turn of the wrist which sent that Levantine
devil’s toothpick spinning. Well, and how
are you?”</p>

<p>The men had sat down beside each other on
the garden chair. Castleton produced a cigarette-case
almost as fat as himself, on which a daintily-painted
ballet girl disported.</p>

<p>“Try one!” he said; “they are ripping.
Bingham Pasha sent them to me himself. He
got them from the Sultan.”</p>

<p>Jacynth took a cigarette, lit it from the end of
his own, Castleton watching him all the time with
the most jocular expression.</p>

<p>“You’re not looking very fit,” he said. “Those
confounded courts, I suppose. By Jove! I
shouldn’t like to be a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right,” Jacynth said; “I’m not
taking the waters here. My sister lives here, and
I’ve a festive little nephew. I only came here for
a rest. I don’t quite know why I came here just
now though. Kismet, I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>As he spoke that same vision of face and hair
and eyes floated up before him.</p>

<p>Castleton laughed more boisterously than ever.</p>

<p>“Ah! Kismet, the dear old word. Yes, I suppose
it’s fate that makes us do most of the things
which we seem to do for no particular reason.”</p>

<p>“Has Kismet brought you here?” Jacynth
inquired. “You seem fit enough at all events.”</p>

<p>“Fit, my dear fellow? not at all.”</p>

<p>It was one of Castleton’s little jocularities with
life to consider himself likely at any moment to
become a confirmed invalid. “I was up in Bagdad,
and I picked up an English paper which
said that Harrogate was looking lovely, and
somehow I felt homesick and seedy, and all that
sort of thing, so I just cut the East and came
slap on here.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Jacynth gravely, “that
there are moments when I feel much more inclined
to cut the West and go, as you say, ‘slap
on’ to some sleepy Eastern place—Bagdad perhaps,
or Japan—and dream away the rest of my
life.”</p>

<p>“The rest of your life? You talk as if you
were ninety!” And Castleton slapped his fat
little leg merrily.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know what the man-at-arms says in
Thackeray’s ballad?” Jacynth replied. “‘Wait
till you come to forty year.’ Well, I have come
to forty year, pretty nearly. I was thirty-nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
three weeks ago—and do you know, Castleton,
there are times when I’m tired of the whole business.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! what would the judges say if they
heard the famous Clitheroe Jacynth talking like
this?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I’m not famous, and if I
were, what’s the good of being famous at the
price of becoming a fossil?”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” said Castleton, with a grin,
“I believe you must be mashed on somebody or
other, by Jove, I do. If you talk——”</p>

<p>Before Castleton had finished his sentence he
became aware that Jacynth was not paying him
much attention. In fact, Jacynth’s gaze seemed
to be directed very intently toward the end of
the garden, and Jacynth’s mind appeared to be
giving no heed whatever to Castleton’s amiable
garrulity. So Castleton, following the direction
of his friend’s glance, saw in the distance a
woman’s form, a form that was familiar to him, a
form that he had already seen that day.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said Castleton to himself softly.
He had no time to say more, even to himself, for
Jacynth had jumped to his feet and was bidding
him good-by.</p>

<p>“Glad to have met you, hope to see you soon
again.” These were the words Jacynth was saying,
with a confusion curiously at variation with
his habitual composure. He shook Castleton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
warmly by the hand, and moved away so rapidly
that Castleton’s, “Why, my dear boy, of course
you will; I shall stop here for ever so long,” was
delivered to the empty air.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” Castleton said again, this time
aloud, as he watched Jacynth’s rapid advance in
the direction of the girl. “By Jove, he’s struck,
like all the lot. Poor devil! I’ll stay here and
give him a hint presently. Oh, poor devil, poor
devil!” And Castleton’s jolly face expressed as
much honest commiseration as its ruddy plumpness
permitted.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Jacynth, walking rapidly, had
met the girl. She smiled a welcome to him, and
stopped as he stopped. Her face seemed troubled,
he thought, in spite of its enchanting smile.</p>

<p>“How grave you look,” he began, for want of
anything better to say.</p>

<p>“How grave you look,” she retorted, with a
flash of the familiar enchanting audacity, as she
looked up into his grave dark face.</p>

<p>“I have something to say to you,” said Jacynth.
The remark was commonplace enough, but he
felt his voice fail as he said it, and he knew by
the sudden heat in his face that the blood was
filling his pale cheeks.</p>

<p>The sound of his voice evidently impressed the
girl, for she looked up at him with a sudden start,
and her reply was queerly girlish and puzzled.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Then, as if she felt suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
conscious of a blunder, or of unexpected knowledge,
she tried to add other words:</p>

<p>“I mean, of course—I do not understand—I
am looking for Ronny.”</p>

<p>“Ronny is quite safe,” said Jacynth gravely.
“He is still at cricket with Harold. What I have
to say does concern him though, a little.”</p>

<p>“Concern Ronny!” There was a genuine note
of alarm in the girl’s fresh voice, and she looked
up at Jacynth with a wistful trouble in her eyes.
“Concern Ronny! Why, what have you to say
about Ronny?”</p>

<p>“Can you give me a few moments?” he asked.
“It is quiet here.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a pathway more secluded than
the rest, a pathway with a rustic garden chair, a
deserted pathway.</p>

<p>“Shall we sit here for a minute?” he said, and
they walked to the rustic seat, and sat down side
by side. There was a curious look of alarm in
the hazel-colored eyes, but Jacynth did not notice
it, for he was looking down, tracing a word upon
the ground with his stick, and the word that he
traced was the word he had used but now, Kismet.</p>

<p>“What do you want to say to me?” He could
hear a hard ring in her voice, and looking up he
saw a hardness in her eyes, and his lips trembled.</p>

<p>“We have been very good friends,” he began,
and faltered. She caught him up.</p>

<p>“We have been good friends,” she said. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
you wish us to be good friends any more you will
not say what it is just possible that you may think
of saying. There are some words which will estrange
us for ever.”</p>

<p>Jacynth looked at her despairingly. How exquisitely
lovely she looked, like some angel of
youth, some vision of summer in that autumnal
garden. His heart seemed to be beating very
fast, his eyes were hot, and his lips dry, and his
hands trembled feverishly.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he said, and as he spoke his own
voice sounded far away and unfamiliar like the
voice of some shadow encountered in a dream.
“Listen! I love you with all my heart. Hush!
let me say what I have got to say”—for she had
turned to him, half appealing, as if to interrupt
his declaration—“I daresay you may think it
very audacious of me to love you—or, at least,
for I could not help loving you, to tell you so. I
know that you are beautiful enough and good
enough to be addressed by better men than I. I
should have been content with my secret love and
held my peace. But I couldn’t—I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment. She laid her hand
on his gently, and he trembled at her touch. “I
am very sorry,” she began, but he went on again
wildly:</p>

<p>“I am not quite a fool. Men who are not quite
fools either say that I have a great career before
me. I have made something of a name as it is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
although I may still almost speak of myself as a
young man. You shall be proud of me, indeed,
I promise you that, if you will only let me serve
you. Life is all a game of chances, but if you
will take this chance, I do not think that you
will regret it. Your lover will not be quite unworthy
of your love.”</p>

<p>“I am very, very sorry,” she said, “but you
have said the words which must divide us. I did
like you, I do like you very much, but we cannot
be friends any more.”</p>

<p>“You cannot love me,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“I cannot love you—and I know we cannot be
friends. You are not that kind of man. It would
tear your heart to pieces. Better one wrench at
once and be done with it. And I am not the
kind of woman to accept friendship that I knew
was only a mask for love.”</p>

<p>“You cannot love me?” he asked again monotonously,
like a man repeating some set formula.</p>

<p>“I cannot love you. I have played with my
life in my own way, and as I have played so I will
pay. Now, good-by, I know you too well and
trust you too well to fear that you will trouble
me at all. You will go away, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jacynth moodily, “I will go
away.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, and good-by.” She moved away
swiftly, and he stood there staring after her until
she disappeared inside the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Jacynth walked moodily back into the garden
and stared sullenly at the bright sky. If the
autumn day, so warm that it might have been
midsummer, had suddenly changed to winter, it
could not have looked colder or more dismal to
his eyes. He shrugged his shoulders. “So that’s
all over,” he said to himself bitterly; “you have
played your stake and you have lost, and now you
must remember that it is your duty to play the
man and not the fool.” Thrusting his hands into
his pockets he began to walk slowly down the
garden path, feeling very dull and dizzy, like a
man who has had a heavy fall. He was thinking,
or trying to think, of things which interested
him so deeply once, and which now seemed so
strangely uninteresting, when his meditations
were interrupted. He found himself confronted
by Castleton, who was eying him sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Old man,” said Castleton, “you saved my life
once, and though it wasn’t much worth saving,
I’m devilish grateful to you all the same. So I’d
like to do you a good turn now if I can.”</p>

<p>“You can’t do me any good,” Jacynth answered,
“there’s nothing the matter with me. Don’t talk
rot, there’s a good fellow.”</p>

<p>“There’s a great deal the matter with you, and
I can do you good,” Castleton answered. “I can
tell you all about that woman.”</p>

<p>But this case is so plain ... that nothing can obscure it, but
to use too many words about it.—<span class="smcap">Jeremy Taylor.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Castleton</span>, doubtless, did not literally
believe that he could tell his friend “all about”
that woman. But he probably was possessed
with the conviction that when he should have
said what he had to say, there would remain little
more worth telling. We smile with a kind of
fatigued contempt at the venerable classical joke
of the fool who, wishing to sell his house, carried
about a brick from it as a specimen. We know
better how to judge of houses. But we are willing—sometimes—to
pick off a very small fragment
of human life, and to exclaim knowingly,
“Look here, <i>I’ll</i> tell you what it is made of!”</p>

<p>Lord Castleton’s well-meant offer was not received
with gratitude.</p>

<p>“What woman?” growled Jacynth, taking one
hand out of his pocket to tilt his hat a little more
over his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Why, Mrs.—Miss—Lady—by Jove, I scarcely
know what to call her!”</p>

<p>“That’s a good beginning,” said Jacynth sardonically.</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear fellow, I really do know all
about her; only it’s—it’s a little puzzling where
to begin.”</p>

<p>“Why begin?”</p>

<p>The fat little gentleman reddened and frowned.
Then his good nature, and his sense of obligation
to the other man, and his pity for him (which,
perhaps, rendered the sense of obligation easier
to bear) conquered the momentary irritation.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Jacynth,” he said, “I consider it
my duty to tell you the story of Fenella Ffrench.
No one knows it better than I do. You may
hear it told by a score of men in town, who will
be a deuced deal harder on the girl than I am.
I have no animosity against her, poor little fool—none
in the world. In fact, I rather like her.”</p>

<p>“Very gratifying to the lady; but—excuse
me—not of palpitating interest to me. Good-by.
I think I shall go for a long spin.”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment, Jacynth! Did you never
hear of Lady Francis Onslow?”</p>

<p>Jacynth turned round sharply and looked at
him. “Lady Francis Onslow?” he repeated,
putting his hand to his forehead and looking as
though he were trying to recall some half-effaced
recollections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Lady Francis Onslow. She was a daughter
of Colonel Fortescue Ffrench, of Crimean celebrity,
and she married Frank Onslow when she
was only seventeen, and three years afterward
they were separated.”</p>

<p>“Is that the woman?”</p>

<p>“That is the woman.”</p>

<p>“She looks such a child!”</p>

<p>“I told you she was married when she was
only seventeen.”</p>

<p>“But he—Lord Francis—he is alive?”</p>

<p>“Very much so! At least he looked alive
enough when I saw him about half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“He is <i>here</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Look here, Jacynth; just let us take
a turn somewhere; here, this is a quiet path,
and——”</p>

<p>“No; not there!” said Jacynth, drawing back
roughly, as Lord Castleton laid his hand on his
arm. It was the pathway where he had just
been speaking with Fenella. “I don’t know
why I should listen to you at all. What does
it matter? Nothing you can say will do any
good.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he did listen. What man would
not have listened? That he should believe it
when it was told was another matter. Jacynth
was a clever man, a man of brilliant talents and
rising reputation in his profession. He had also
certain special gifts which were not so generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
recognized. He had a keen and almost intuitive
insight into character, and a steady power of incredulity
as to a vast proportion of the stories
circulated in the “best society” on the “best
authority.”</p>

<p>At first sight this may seem no very extraordinary
power. And perhaps it is not extraordinary,
but it is certainly not common. The
gossip of the smoking room, the little tattle of
the clubs, penetrate, as a fine drizzling rain penetrates
one’s clothing, into the consciousness of
most men.</p>

<p>Men may declare that they give no heed to
that sort of gossip; but, as a rule, their minds are
porous, and do not resist it. With persons who
pride themselves on knowing the world, credulity
has almost come to signify believing good of
men’s neighbors. But Jacynth had often been
cynically amused by the childish credulity with
which a knot of men at his club would swallow
evil stories, intrinsically improbable, and supported
by no tittle of evidence that he would
have dared to offer to the least enlightened of
juries, merely because they were evil. For these
gentlemen “knew the world.” Something he
dimly remembered hearing of the separation
which had taken place between Lord and Lady
Francis Onslow; but nothing clearly. He had
not lived in their world; he did not now live
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>He had a poor opinion of Lord Castleton’s intellect,
but he believed him to be as truthful as he
knew how to be. Jacynth was quite capable
of disbelieving a story against a woman, even
though she were young, beautiful, full of impulsive
high spirit, and separated from her husband,
and even although he had not happened to be in
love with her. He did not intend to break a
lance on her behalf. He was not given to such
breaking of lances, for he also “knew the world.”
But neither was he going to accept Lord Castleton’s
statements with the undoubting faith that
Lord Castleton seemed to expect. Nevertheless
he listened.</p>

<p>“She was an only child, you know,” said Lord
Castleton, hooking himself on to his companion’s
arm, so as to speak confidentially in his ear as
they walked up and down, “idolized by her
father. Her mother died when she was a small
child, so she was left to take pretty much her
own way ever since she was six years old.
Ffrench got some old woman or other to look
after her as she grew older—a kind of duenna,
you know. But as to controlling her, it was a
mere farce. Fenella did as she pleased with the
colonel, and the colonel did as he pleased with
everybody else, for he was a Tartar, and never
allowed any member of his household to contradict
him—always with the one exception, you
know; and so the end of it was that every man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
woman, and child about the place had to be Miss
Fenella’s very humble servant, or had to go.
She was the wildest little beggar; used to go
tearing about the country on a little Arab horse
she had. Once she took it into her head to ride
to hounds, and, by George, sir, she went flying
over everything that came in her way and was
in at the death! The only woman there; just
think of that! A child not fifteen riding to
hounds quite alone, for the old groom who used
to trot about after her could no more keep up
with her than if he’d been mounted on a tortoise.”</p>

<p>A vision of the slight, straight, fearless young
creature, with a wave of tawny hair floating behind
her, the wonderful hazel eyes shining, and
the delicate cheeks glowing like roses, came
vividly before Mr. Jacynth’s mind as he listened.</p>

<p>“I know that story’s true,” continued Castleton.
“Old Lord Furzeby, who was Master at
that time, and had been hunting the county for
twenty years, told me it himself; and said he’d
never seen anything like it. However, he called
next day on her father, and then Ffrench did put
a stop to the hunting. He wouldn’t quite stand
that.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Jacynth, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just a specimen of the way she
was brought up. But there were worse things
than the hunting, a deuced sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“What things?” growled Jacynth, flashing a
dark side glance at his companion’s round rubicund
face.</p>

<p>“I—upon my soul, I think they may be all
summed up in one word—flirtation! Of all the
outrageous, audacious, insatiable little flirts that
ever were born for the botheration of mankind,
I suppose Fenella Ffrench is about the completest
specimen.”</p>

<p>“Poor mankind!” sneered Jacynth, drawing
down the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, she began when she was in
short frocks. I’ve no doubt the man where she
bought her hoops and dolls was in love with her.
And when she began to grow up it was a general
massacre.”</p>

<p>“Not of the innocents, however,” muttered
Jacynth.</p>

<p>“Ffrench’s place was in Hampshire, not quite
out of reach by a drive from Portsmouth, although
it was a long pull by road. And before
she was sixteen, Fenella had bowled over the
whole garrison. I believe the local chemist expected
a wholesale order for prussic acid the day
her engagement to Frank Onslow was announced,”
said his fat little lordship, chuckling
at his own wit.</p>

<p>“Where did she meet him?”</p>

<p>“At a garrison ball in Portsmouth. It was
supposed to be a case of love at first sight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Regular Romeo-and-Juliet business, don’t you
know?”</p>

<p>“Oh! she loved him?” said Jacynth, between
his set teeth.</p>

<p>“God knows! she said she did, any way; and
made him believe it. As for him, he was desperately
mashed.”</p>

<p>“And so—and so they married, but didn’t live
happy ever after.”</p>

<p>“No, by George! It didn’t last long. For
the first year or two, it was all billing and cooing.
They took a little place in Surrey, and
gave themselves up to rurality and domestic
affection. Old Ffrench used to spend half his
time there with ’em. And when Fenella’s boy
was born, they had a story that the colonel was
seen wheeling a perambulator about the garden,
and administering a feeding-bottle. It did seem
as though Fenella had begun to put a good deal
of water in her wine, as the Italians say. They
hadn’t been married three years when Colonel
Ffrench died suddenly. I was not in England at
the time. I was in a very low state—all to
pieces! In fact, Sir Abel Adamson has since
confessed that he thought my nervous system—however,
that will probably not interest you.
I set off on a long sea voyage, which they said
was my best chance. And, in point of fact, I
prowled about for more than a year and a half.
It was in Japan that I got hold of an old <i>Times</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
with the announcement of Ffrench’s death.
Oho! thought I to myself. My Lady Francis
Onslow will come in for a nice little pile. She
had something when she married. And, of
course, Ffrench left her everything he had in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Then Lord Francis Onslow hadn’t made a bad
thing of it?”</p>

<p>“A very good thing of it!—from the financial
point of view, that is. He was a duke’s son; but
I needn’t tell you that a duke’s fifth son——”</p>

<p>“Can’t expect to marry a lady from Chicago
or New York with millions of dollars in pigs or
petroleum. Of course not! That’s reserved for
his seniors,” said Jacynth.</p>

<p>Lord Castleton laughed. But he did not quite
like this little speech. He considered himself
the least bumptious of men about his rank. But
there was something in Jacynth’s words—a twang,
not only of bitterness, but of contempt—which
Lord Castleton inwardly pronounced to be “bad
form.” But Jacynth was sore, poor wretch!
Terribly sore! However, his lordship compressed
his narrative somewhat, as being very doubtful
what venomed criticism might be lurking in the
barrister’s mind.</p>

<p>“Well, the main point of the story is what
happened after the colonel’s death, and when
Frank Onslow and his wife went up to town. Only
I thought it well to give you a glimpse of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
madcap sort of life the girl had been allowed to
lead, because it, to some degree, explains a good
deal of her reckless way of carrying on.”</p>

<p>Lord Castleton fancied he heard Jacynth mutter
under his breath, “Poor child!” But the
clean-shaven, firmly molded jaw looked set and
grim when he glanced at it; and a countenance
less expressive of any “compunctious visitings”
of sentiment than the countenance of Clitheroe
Jacynth, barrister-at-law, as it appeared in that
moment, it would be difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>“Lady Francis made one of the biggest sensations
I can remember, when she began to get into
the swing of London society. She had been presented
on her marriage, of course. But then
Frank had carried her off to the cottage in Surrey,
and the world had seen no more of her, so that
now she appeared as a novelty. And she is—well,
you know what she is to look at. I know dozens
of women handsomer by line and rule. But
there’s something fetching about Fenella that I
never saw equaled. And then the old game began
again. Fellows were mad about her, and she
flirted in the wildest way.”</p>

<p>“The Romeo-and-Juliet passion having meanwhile
died a natural death?” said Jacynth, staring
straight before him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose so. The fact is, she is a butterfly
kind of creature that no man ought ever to
have taken seriously.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“And the husband——”</p>

<p>“Frank was—well, the fact is, Frank acted like
a fool. He was very young, too, you know. They
were like a couple of children together, and used
to squabble, and kiss, and make it up like children.
Frank never had the least suspicion of jealousy
about her, though. Never—until——”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” exclaimed Jacynth, with a nod of
the head.</p>

<p>“Well, whether his aunt, old Lady Grizel, put
it into his head, or whether he saw something for
himself that he didn’t like—the fact is, Frank
made a scene one night when they came home
from a ball at the Austrian Embassy, and Fenella—who
is the Tartar’s own daughter when she’s
roused, I can tell you, dynamite isn’t in it!—flared
up tremendously, and there was, in short,
the devil to pay. Fenella, it seems, had been
secretly bottling up a little private jealousy on
her own part. There was a certain Madame—her
name don’t matter; and she has returned to Mongolia
or wherever she came from long ago—a certain
woman, pretty nearly old enough to be
Frank’s mother, but a fascinating sort of Jezebel,
whom you met about everywhere that season.
And Fenella turned round and declared that
Frank had been making her miserable by his
goings-on with that vile woman!”</p>

<p>“All her foolish fancy, of course!” said
Jacynth, suddenly looking at the other man with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
a penetrating gaze from beneath his frowning
black brows.</p>

<p>“Oh—well—you know—oh, I daresay Frank
had, to some extent, been making an ass of himself.
But, of course, the case was totally different.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course.”</p>

<p>“Fenella talked like a wild Indian, you know.
It couldn’t be supposed that because Lord Francis
Onslow kicked up his heels rather more than
was exactly pretty, Lady Francis Onslow was to
be allowed to follow suit. He had taken exception
to a certain man—military attaché to one of
the Embassies—and forbade Fenella to dance
with him or receive him in her drawing room.
Needless to say that Fenella made a point of
waltzing with him the next night, and of giving
him a standing invitation to five o’clock tea.
More rows. Family consultations. Aunt Grizel
volunteering as peace-maker; I think that was
the last straw. Fenella insisted on a separation;
she was as obstinate as possible. She would
take her boy and leave him. As to the money,
he might keep it all. And that sort of wild nonsense.”</p>

<p>“But she carried her point? She left him?
How was it possible that he let her go?”</p>

<p>“My dear friend, the idea of talking of ‘letting’
or not letting Fenella Onslow do anything
she had set her will on is refreshingly <i>naïf</i>. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
threatened them that if they did not consent to
an amicable arrangement she would bring legal
proceedings (on account of the Mongolian fascinator!)
and make a scandal. Well, the Onslows
hate the name of a scandal as a mad dog
hates water.”</p>

<p>“Or as a burnt child dreads the fire,” put in
Jacynth.</p>

<p>“At any rate, among them they cobbled up
the deed of separation; and there is poor Frank
with a wife and no wife, and the boy—he was
devoted to the little chap—taken away from him,
at any rate for some years.”</p>

<p>“And there is Lady Francis Onslow with a
husband and no husband.”</p>

<p>“Upon my soul I believe she’s happier without
him, upon my soul I do! All she cares for in life
is to flirt; to decoy some wretched fellow into a
desperate state about her, and then to turn him
off with an impudent little assumption of innocence,
and declare she meant nothing. People
said there was more in that affair of the military
attaché, than her usual coquetries. But I don’t
know. I don’t believe she has it in her power to
care for any man. However, very few of those
who saw the little drama being acted before their
eyes take a lenient view of Fenella’s conduct. I
felt bound to open your eyes, Jacynth. The
woman is as dangerous as a rattlesnake. Of
course she’s gone and made a hideous hash of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
her own life; but she has done worse than that
to other people’s lives, and she’ll go on doing
it. I saw her just now sitting up on the box-seat
of the coach beside her husband, and——”</p>

<p>“Beside <i>whom</i>?”</p>

<p>“Beside her husband, Frank Onslow. There’s
nothing she hasn’t impudence enough for! It
wouldn’t surprise me if they were to come together
again.”</p>

<p>“And that,” said Jacynth, walking away by
himself, “is what Castleton calls telling me ‘all
about that woman!’ I don’t know whom she
loves, nor whether she loves anyone at this present
moment. But that there are depths of feeling
in that girl of which old Castleton is about as
well able to judge as a mole of the solar system—but
what’s the good of it! I have played
my stake and lost it. I—I must get out of this
place if I’m to keep any hold over myself at all.
How could a raw lad like Frank Onslow value
her or understand her? Of course, he was selfish
and unreasonable and dull to all the finer part of
her nature, like a boy as he is—or was, at any
rate, when he married her!” He went up to his
room and dragged out a portmanteau. He must
get away. There was no use in parleying or delay.
Flight, instant flight, was the only thing
for him. But when he had opened the portmanteau,
and dragged out a few clothes from the
chest of drawers, he sat down by the bedside and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
buried his face in the pillow. “I love her! I
love her!” he moaned out. And then he hated
himself for his folly.</p>

<p>At this moment a little childish footstep was
heard tramping up the stairs; tap—tap—tap—tap,
climbing up with much exertion, but with
eager haste, and then a sweet little childish voice
said, “Mr. Jacymf, Mr. Jacymf, are you there?”</p>

<p>Jacynth opened the door with a wildly beating
heart. Could she have sent him a message?
“What is it, Ronny, my man?” he said, looking
down upon the child’s curly, tawny hair and
bright, innocent, hazel eyes that were so like his
mother’s.</p>

<p>“Hulloa!” cried Ronny, surveying the portmanteau
and the litter of clothes on the floor,
“are you going away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, old boy.”</p>

<p>“Is Grandison going too?”</p>

<p>“No; not Grandison. What do you want,
Ronny?”</p>

<p>“I want you not to go away!”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why can’t you come with us, if you <i>are</i>
going away?”</p>

<p>“Come with you? Where?”</p>

<p>“With me and Mummy. Mummy says we
shall go to a nicer place than this. And I may
play cricket. I wanted you to come and play
with me and Grandison. But I s’pose you can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
if you’re packing your clothes. Aint they in a
jolly mess?”</p>

<p>Jacynth lifted the child up in his arms and
kissed him. “Good-by, Ronny,” he said, in a
queer, choking voice; and then he set the little
fellow outside the door and shut it.</p>

<p>Ronny prepared to make the descent of the
staircase, holding tight to the banisters. He put
one little chubby finger up to his cheek and
looked at it. “Hulloa!” said he very gravely,
“my face is all wet!”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> single short drive on the Harrogate coach
had re-awakened all Frank Onslow’s dormant
passion for the capricious and beautiful woman
whom he had made his wife. His weak and
pliant nature was one which could readily forget,
and after a few weeks of dull pain his separation
had ceased to be a grief to him, and he had devoted
himself to the turf and the green table with
an energy which had driven his matrimonial
troubles from his mind. That Fenella had at the
least been indiscreet in the case of the Count de
Mürger was beyond all question. Further, she
had allowed her indiscretion to be known and
commented upon. Domestic unhappiness is ill
to bear, but worse still is it to see pitying eyes
turned upon one in society, to read snappy little
two-edged paragraphs in gossiping papers, or in a
club smoking room to see heads incline toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
each other while a swift malicious whisper passes
from man to man. All this is bad to bear, and
yet it had been Lord Francis’s lot to bear it. It
had soured his mind and hardened his heart at
the time of his separation.</p>

<p>But every wound will heal, and this one also
had skinned over. When in the morning he had
seen the girlish figure of his wife perched upon
the box-seat, with her yellow hair curling from
under the dainty hat, and looked into the hazel
eyes which still shone with the old provoking,
mischievous, challenging twinkle, he had felt his
heart go out to her, and had loved her once more
even as he loved her on that first night when
he had plighted his troth to her after the garrison
ball at Portsmouth. It maddened him now
to find that, with all the fire of his love, he could
not kindle any answering spark in her. Had
she turned away from him, treated him coldly,
or upbraided him for his conduct, then indeed he
might have had hopes. A quarrel might lead to
a reconciliation. But that she should treat him
as an everyday acquaintance, gossip with him
about trivial matters, and break small jests with
him, that was indeed intolerable. In vain,
through the long drive, he strove to pass the
barrier. At every allusion to their married life,
or to their quarrel, she either retired into absolute
silence or else with quick feminine tact turned the
conversation into other channels. If he had forgiven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
her there was no sign that she in turn had
forgiven him.</p>

<p>And who was there who knew better than himself
that there was much to forgive? If her name
had been coupled with that of the Count de Mürger,
had not his been equally and even more
openly associated with the notorious Mme. Lucille
de Vigny? He might have doubts as to
his wife’s guilt, but he could have none as to his
own. If he had been subjected to the degradation
of the pity of his fellow-men, had not she undergone
as much or more? He remembered now
with grief and compunction how day after day,
and evening after evening, he had deserted his
wife in favor of the society of the fascinating
Frenchwoman. He remembered, too, how patient
she had been at first. Then, how her
patience had gradually changed to surprise, surprise
to suspicion, suspicion to anger, and anger
to revenge in the shape of the flirtation which had
brought about the separation. Who was he, to
blame her? He had himself been the first to sin.
Now he was the first to forgive. Would she follow
him in the one as in the other?</p>

<p>Alas! it seemed that she would not—that the
breach was too broad to be ever again bridged
over. Through the bright summer morning, as
they rattled past the lines of beech trees, and
through the pleasant Yorkshire lanes, he chafed
and fretted, but in vain. His sin had been too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
deep to be forgiven. As he handed her down,
when they arrived once more at the Prospect
Hotel, he pressed her little hands in his feverish
grasp, and looked appealingly into her hazel eyes.
There was no answering softness in their glance—nothing
but amusement and something akin to
contempt. He turned away with a sigh, and wandered
slowly off in the direction of the gardens,
walking with bent head, and the listless steps of
a melancholy man.</p>

<p>Had his eyes not been downcast he might have
noticed that he was not alone on the graveled,
hedge-lined walk, which curved down through the
pleasant Harrogate gardens. A woman was
walking toward him, moving slowly through the
rich yellow sunshine, and glancing from right to
left with the air of one who is a visitor and a
sight-seer. Her light cream dress, her dainty
pink sunshade, and her broad shady hat, with its
curling snow-white feather, made a pleasant picture
to the eye, which was by no means diminished
by her approach, for she was a woman of
singular beauty. Though past her first youth,
the lines of her figure were as graceful and perfect
as an artist could desire, while her face, with
its dark Southern beauty, its clear-cut, delicate
features, and imperious eyes, spoke of a passionate
and impetuous nature, such as is seldom to be
found among our cold and self-contained Northern
races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Approaching from different ends of the walk
the two had almost passed each other before Lord
Francis looked up, and their eyes met. He
sprang back with a cry of surprise, and of something
approaching to dismay, while she stood
quietly looking at him out of somber, deeply-questioning
eyes.</p>

<p>“Lucille!” he gasped. “You are the last person
whom I expected to see in Harrogate.”</p>

<p>“But I am not surprised,” she answered,
speaking with a slight French lisp, which added
a charm to her rich, deep voice. “I knew that
you were in Harrogate. That is why I came.”</p>

<p>“But why do you wish to follow me, Lucille?
What good can come of it?”</p>

<p>“What good? All good. Is not love good?
And do I not love you? Ah, Frank, you taught
me to love you, and how can I unlearn it? It is
happiness to me to see you and to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“But see the misery that it has caused. We
must part, Lucille. If you truly love me you
will help me to retrieve my life, and not to wreck
it further.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried she, with a quick flash in her dark
eyes. “You have seen her. You have been
speaking with your wife again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw her to-day.”</p>

<p>“By chance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by chance.”</p>

<p>“And you are friends again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“No, not friends.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you wished it, but she would not have it.
I can see it in your face. O Frank, how could
you humble yourself to such a woman? How
could you? To hold out your hand to her and to
be refused! <i>Quelle dégradation!</i> See how she
has treated you—she, who is not worthy to be
the wife of any honest man.”</p>

<p>The color sprang to Onslow’s pale cheeks. It
was one thing to know his wife’s faults, and it was
another to hear about them.</p>

<p>“That is an old story,” he said curtly. “We
may let that drop.”</p>

<p>“An old story? Why, she was with De Mürger
last week in London.”</p>

<p>“Fenella was?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw them with my own eyes riding
together in the Row.”</p>

<p>Lord Francis started as if he had been stung.
“Come here!” he said. There was a garden
bench in a little recess, and he threw himself down
upon it. Lucille de Vigny seated herself beside
him, and a triumphant smile played over her dark
and beautiful face as she marked with a sidelong
glance the anger and chagrin which convulsed her
companion’s features.</p>

<p>“Is this true?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Frank, that I saw them with my
own eyes. It is not my custom to say what is not
true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“They were riding together?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And talking?”</p>

<p>“Talking and laughing.”</p>

<p>“By heavens, I will see that fellow De Mürger.
I will shoot him, Lucille. It is not our custom in
England to duel. But he is a foreigner. He will
meet me. I have wished to avoid a scandal, but
if they court one why should I spare them? In
the Row, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and just when all the world was
there.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! it is maddening.” He sank his
face in his hands and groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“And what matter, after all?” said she, laying
one delicately gloved hand upon his wrist. “Why
should you trouble? What is she to you now?
She is unworthy, and that is an end. <i>Tout est
fini.</i> You are a free man, and may let her go her
way while you go yours. Which way will be
yours, Frank?”</p>

<p>The blood throbbed in his head. He felt her
warm, magnetic hand tighten upon his wrist.
Her soft, lisping voice, and the delicate perfume
which came from her dress, seemed to lull the
misery which had torn him. Already, in her presence,
the fierce longing for his wife which had
possessed him was growing more faint. Here was
a woman, beautiful and tender, who did indeed
love him. Why should his heart still dwell upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
that other one who had brought unhappiness and
disgrace to him?</p>

<p>“Which way will be yours, Frank?”</p>

<p>“The same as yours, Lucille.”</p>

<p>“Ah, at last!” she cried, throwing her arms
about him. “Did I not know that I should win
you back?”</p>

<p>A sharp cry, a cry as from a stricken heart, and
a dark shadow fell between the pair. Lord
Francis started to his feet. Fenella was standing
in front of them, her hands thrown out, her eyes
blazing with anger.</p>

<p>“You villain!” she gasped. “You false villain!”
She put her hands to her throat, and
struggled with her words like a choking woman.
Lord Francis Onslow looked down, while the
blood flushed to his temple. Mme. de Vigny
stood beside him, her hands folded across each
other, and a look of defiance and anger upon her
face.</p>

<p>“I came out here to tell you that I had forgiven
you. Do you hear? That I had forgiven
you. And this is how I find you. Oh, I shall
never forgive you now—never, never, never!
Why were you so nice to me this morning, if you
meant to treat me so?”</p>

<p>“One word, Fenella,” cried Onslow. “Answer
me one question, and if I have wronged you
I will go down on my bended knees to you. Tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
me truthfully, and on your honor, were you in
the company of De Mürger last week?”</p>

<p>“And if I were, sir?”</p>

<p>“Were you or were you not?”</p>

<p>“I was.”</p>

<p>“You were with him in the Park?”</p>

<p>“I was.”</p>

<p>“Then that is enough. I have no more to say.
Madame, let me offer you my arm!” He walked
past his wife with her rival, and the dresses of the
two women would have touched had Fenella
not sprung back with a cry of disgust, as one
who shrinks from a poisonous thing. Mme. de
Vigny laughed, and her proud sparkling eyes told
of the triumph which filled her soul.</p>

<p>Fenella Onslow stood for an instant in the
middle of the sunlit walk, her little right hand
clenched with anger, her gaze turned toward the
retreating figures. Then a sudden lurid thought
flashed into her mind, and she started off as
rapidly as she could in the direction of the railway
station. Clitheroe Jacynth’s train did not
leave for ten minutes. Ronny had told her of
the hour of his departure. The barrister was
standing, moody and disconsolate, upon the platform,
when he felt a light touch upon his
shoulder, and looking round, saw a flushed little
woman, with sparkling eyes, looking up at him.</p>

<p>“Fenella!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Yes, you must not go.”</p>

<p>“Not go?”</p>

<p>“No, you must come back.”</p>

<p>“You bid me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I bid you. You must come back to the
hotel.”</p>

<p>“But it was you who this very morning drove
me away from it.”</p>

<p>“Forget it. Many things have happened since
then. Will you not come?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I will come.”</p>

<p>“Then give me your arm.”</p>

<p>And so it happened that as Lord Francis
Onslow and Mme. Lucille de Vigny stood at
the door of the Prospect Hotel after their walk,
they perceived Lady Francis and a gentleman
whom neither of them had seen before coming
toward them arm-in-arm, and engaged in the
most intimate conversation.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I’ve</span> wired for him!” Fenella imparted in a
startling burst of confidence. “Ronny and I got
up early and ran down to the telegraph office.”</p>

<p>“My <i>goodness</i>!” Jacynth stared in resentful
dismay at her sparkling eyes. “Well! you have
made a nice complication, now.”</p>

<p>The girl laid a beseeching hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so furious; and do—do stand by
me in everything as you promised. Remember,
you are my only friend here—except Ronny.”</p>

<p>“I have promised,” he said solemnly. “But
you might consult me as a friend. And why do
anything so rash—mad?”</p>

<p>“Because all my life I have taken my own way.
Because if he comes here to vex me, when we
were all quite happy”—she set her small white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
teeth—“and flaunts <i>that creature</i> before my very
face, I will show him the red rag he hates worst!
Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.”</p>

<p>“Not always. Take care.”</p>

<p>“Besides, I want to convince you—everyone—that
on my side there is nothing to blame, nothing—while,
Frank—oh, there”—with a pathetic
little break in her voice that makes Clitheroe
wretched—“after having forgotten this miserable
business very nearly—I hardly slept last night—thinking.”</p>

<p>“You are fond of him still, then?” said Jacynth,
very low.</p>

<p>“No! no! I hate him now,” she exclaimed passionately,
apostrophizing the rocks and trees
around. “I should like to divorce him, and—and—see
that poisonous serpent crushed alive.”</p>

<p>“Come, don’t say such terrible things. And
divorce is no such easy matter.”</p>

<p>Jacynth’s heart beat hard as he soothed the
headstrong girl. If she were indeed free! Down,
down, wild hope! Was he not her true friend
and faithful counselor? “So this accounts for
your silence as we drove here. You meant to
spring this surprise on me.”</p>

<p>Fenella nodded, mischief simply brimming
over in her suddenly transformed little face.</p>

<p>“If I get into a scrape, you’ve got to get me
out. It’s a duel, you see, between four of us,
with you and Lord Castleton for seconds, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
come of a fighting family,” her feet breaking
under her into a few steps of war dance. “Oh,
<i>look there</i>!”</p>

<p>Her shriek rang far and shrill through the
Knaresborough rocks, as, stiffened suddenly to
stone, she stood with outstretched arms, her
straining eyes gazing up at the cliff. A small
object had hurtled through some brushwood overhead,
and, rolling downward, was now stopped
half-way. It was a little boy, clinging desperately
to a bush at which he had caught.</p>

<p>Before the last sounds had left her parted lips,
Jacynth bounded forward and was clambering,
springing as best he could, up from foothold to
ledge. Many holidays of mountain-climbing
stood him in good stead. Higher still—ah!
there! The bush is giving way slowly at the
roots. A little shower of earth falls down on
Fenella’s upturned face; she has somehow tottered
with quaking knees onward.</p>

<p>Safe—safe! Just as the terrified child feels his
hold giving way, a strong arm catches him round
the waist.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” exclaims a well-known man’s
voice. Fenella feels a little group about her,
summoned by her echoing shriek, but her filming
vision sees nothing till Ronny is placed, pale but
plucky, in her arms. Presently, with the boy
hugging her neck, and her own tight grasp proving
he has no bones broken, she turns to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Frank, looking strangely excited, holding out a
hand to Jacynth.</p>

<p>“Let me thank you. That was splendidly
done. You saved the boy’s life, and I am—I——”
he stammered and stopped, reddening.</p>

<p>“No thanks are needed. I could not tell but
that it was my own little scamp of a nephew.
Where is Grandison?” Jacynth frigidly answered,
looking round. He had driven Fenella and the
two boys out here, because she wished to avoid
meeting her husband and his probable companion.
And, lo! tricksome fate had drawn these
two hither as by some irresistible attraction.</p>

<p>Lucille was meanwhile looking on with intense
apprehension. The child—the child was the sole
remaining link between this man and wife, but
that one how strong! She must interfere rapidly.</p>

<p>Next moment she had dropped on her knees
beside Ronny, who now stood leaning against his
mother, and had tenderly lifted his hand.</p>

<p>“Poor infant—<i>chéri</i>! He is bleeding, see!”</p>

<p>And she softly wiped some trickling drops
from a graze on the chubby, childish fist.</p>

<p>“How dare you? Leave my child alone!”
blazed out Fenella, withdrawing as if from the
touch of a reptile.</p>

<p>Lucille rose with an air of dignified humility,
and looked full at Onslow, with surely a sudden
moisture in her beautiful dark eyes.</p>

<p>“I have made a mistake, it is true. But I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
a woman, and only remembered that a child was
hurt—your child!” The last words were murmured
only for his ear.</p>

<p>“Come away,” said Onslow briefly, but consolingly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A very thunder-cloud, charged with electricity,
overhung the end of one of the long dinner
tables in the Prospect Hotel that evening.</p>

<p>Lord Castleton presided at the foot, the post of
honor. On his right hand, seated thus low, as
befitted new guests, were Lord Francis Onslow,
and, “by Jove! Mme. de Vigny herself.” To his
left Jacynth, faithful to his place beside Fenella,
who had asked the head-waiter some days ago not
to move her seat higher, in usual hotel progression,
opposite a sour-faced set of ladies, with side-ringlets
and warming-pan brooches, who whispered
inuendoes about herself that palled as a
diversion. She had then innocently preferred
new arrivals. So Castleton looked at four freezingly
expressionless faces, four pairs of eyes
bottling up lightnings.</p>

<p>“In for a storm!” he chuckled to himself, rubbing
his plump hands under the table. “But
who is my lady keeping that empty place for on
her other side?”</p>

<p>Just then a slight young man, with blond
curls clustering thickly on his head, well-waxed
mustaches, and a slightly foreign military air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
about the cut of his clothes and the stiffness of
his shoulders, came down the long room with a
buoyant step. Fenella’s eyes gleamed as she
held out her hand in greeting, which the newcomer
pressed with that mingled homage and
effusion betraying a stranger to English customs.</p>

<p>Onslow’s dark face grew suddenly livid with
passion. He made a movement as if about to
rise, but was restrained by an imploring touch on
his arm, and a murmured entreaty from his companion
to be calm.</p>

<p>“You see! I obeyed your message on the
instant,” said the newcomer to Fenella, in an
undertone, audible in the fell silence around.
“Last week you said don’t come—it is <i>stupeed</i>.
Now you say, come!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but we have had some new visitors since
then, and it is <i>much</i> more amusing.”</p>

<p>After which really impudent remark, Fenella
leant back, and with a look of infantile innocence
on her piquante face, indicated Jacynth.</p>

<p>“I want to make you two acquainted. I like
my friends to like each other. Mr. Jacynth—Count
de Mürger.”</p>

<p>The two men’s eyes met. Clitheroe’s gaze
gravely observant, De Mürger momentarily taken
aback, then bowing with gay readiness, as who
should say, “A rival? Come on! measure
swords.”</p>

<p>Next he looked across and started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>It was only a slight start, yet Castleton’s
cheeks at once puffed with suppressed mirth.
Lucille gave the faintest inclination of her handsome
dark head. But Onslow, laying his arms on
the table with a cool superiority that in a less
well-bred man might be offensive, stared at his
enemy full, not stirring a muscle.</p>

<p>The cut was direct, cutting De Mürger short in
an instinctively begun bow of politely cold recognition.
A brilliant smile instantly lightened the
young Austrian’s face. He had suspected a trap,
but now he knew his ground.</p>

<p>An awkward silence ensued. Then Castleton
demanded, in nervous accents:</p>

<p>“What fish <i>is</i> this, waiter—eh?”</p>

<p>“<i>Tom Dory</i>, milord,” answered the recently
imported Teuton with suave readiness.</p>

<p>A little buzz of talk began at once; the spell
was loosed. Under cover of this Castleton bent
forward, irresistibly thirsting to confide in
Jacynth.</p>

<p>“I say, what a game! Would you think De
Mürger is one of the greatest gamblers going,
and a tremendous duelist?”</p>

<p>“That boy! He looks as if dancing was his
strong point.”</p>

<p>“So it is. He is a favorite leader of cotillons—invented
that figure for Lady Birmingham’s
ball of shooting with Cupid’s bows and arrows—you
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“No, I don’t. I am too old for much ball-going,”
answered the barrister curtly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though Fenella never once looked
his way, she felt that her husband’s eyes were
stabbing her with glances like daggers. It hurt;
but she had the sweet revenge of knowing she
was wounding his pride in return, though the
false Circe by his side might try to pour in balm.
So, looking a picture of girlish sweetness in her
delicious white gown, so simple seemingly, so
costly—a white bud of a little creature in contradistinction
to the darker, maturer charms of her
handsome rival, she listened with apparent eagerness
to De Mürger.</p>

<p>“Yes, I should regret not going to Vienna this
summer, if I were not <i>here</i>. You do not know it.
Ah, how I should like to show you our Prater.
And the life, the gayety. How you would
enjoy it!”</p>

<p>“Do you know Vienna?” asked Mme. de
Vigny of Onslow in clear tones, as if her neighbors
were dummies. “It is—how do you say it
in English?—<i>la ville la plus dévergondée</i> in
Europe.”</p>

<p>At the inference that this abandoned capital
will suit herself, in madame’s evident opinion,
Fenella’s pale small cheeks take a sudden rosy
tint, her tawny eyes gleam with quite a tigerish
flash. She throws up her head, challenging
Onslow mutely to dare countenance the insult.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
But Frank’s French is that of Eton, and he
merely ejaculates an “Ah!” impassively.</p>

<p>(“Quarrels are so upsetting to one’s digestion,”
was Castleton’s thought. Yet not for anything
would he have missed the human interest of the
scene, which was “as good as a play.” Still the
lull of talk was ominous, so he desperately addressed
the only person from whom no explosion
was to be feared.)</p>

<p>“What is coming next, waiter?”</p>

<p>“Suckie-pig, sir,” responded the gentle German.</p>

<p>Ronny’s curly pate appearing on a level with
the table-cloth, and nestling between his mother
and Jacynth confidingly, was a welcome diversion.
All eyes turned with relief on the rosy,
roguish face, alone unconscious of hidden trouble
among them.</p>

<p>“It will soon be dessert-time; I may stay,
mayn’t I, mummy?” coaxed the child confidently.</p>

<p>Then to beguile the time, he produced some
glass marbles from his pocket, aiming at the salt-cellar,
where his friend Jacynth fielded and sent
them back. With her arm around her son,
Fenella was chatting animatedly to De Mürger,
rejoicing inwardly in her immense superiority
over her opposite foes in possessing Ronny. A
vagrant ball escaping the latter’s fingers, cannoned
off a dish and flew straight into madame’s
lap. With a secret honeyed glance at Ronny,
she feigned to detain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“No, you mustn’t! That would be stealing,
and then you would be put in prison,” remonstrated
the child. Then looking at her with the
sweet familiarity of one of Raphael’s cherubs,
“<i>Were you ever in prison?</i>”</p>

<p>Mme. de Vigny, who was just lifting a full
glass of claret to her lips, started, so that some
wine was spilt. She raised her delicate brows,
with a glance of charming dismay at Onslow’s
gloomy face.</p>

<p>Castleton and Jacynth, noticing the accident,
exchanged furtive, surprised looks. But Ronny,
no more heeding that red splash than if he had
slopped over his glass of milk, announced in joyous
tones, “Because I was—very nearly. Grandison
and me were very naughty once, and his
nurse tried to give us to a p’leeceman, but we
pulled at her dress so hard she couldn’t; and the
p’leeceman shook his finger at me and said,
‘Next time!’—Oh, I say!”</p>

<p>Suddenly diving, so that his little body eluded
Fenella’s grasp, to her surprise he rushed round
the table and flung himself against Frank, who
had annexed the truant marble, and was ostentatiously
secreting it in his own pocket.</p>

<p>“Give it me! It’s mine! You must! Please!”</p>

<p>Frank held the treasure nearer, then embracing
the boy’s shoulders with one caressing arm,
stooped and deliberately kissed the sweet, childish
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Take it, there. Why, you will soon be old
enough to go to school.”</p>

<p>Raising his head, he looked straight at Fenella
with such defiance that the wrathful jealousy,
boiling within her at so flagrant a show of authority,
suddenly cooled.</p>

<p>With a shiver at the warning, she nevertheless
had spirit to retort with cool, decisive command:
“Ronny, come here. You must stay by me, dear,
and not go to—other people.” Then she rustled
from the table with superb displeasure at Frank’s
unwarrantable liberty. Both De Mürger and
Jacynth sprang up, too, in quick rivalry, as her
bodyguard. They were soon followed by Castleton,
who found it poor fun to watch only Onslow’s
lowering face, and Jezebel, as he secretly
politely designated Mme. de Vigny.</p>

<p>Before the hotel door the night was still and
cool; stars had begun to twinkle in the “blue
vaults, magnificently deep.”</p>

<p>“So you have to suffer such insults,” De Mürger
impetuously whispers in Fenella’s ear. “Let me
avenge you. Ah! you did right to send for me.”</p>

<p>“No, no, you must not take your own way to
help me. Wait—I must just ask Mr. Jacynth to
do something for me. Then I will come back
and talk to <i>you</i>,” murmurs Fenella, frightened,
therefore sweetly deceitful. Then drawing her
mentor apart, while Castleton eagerly fastens on
the prey she has left, she entreats: “Help me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Keep the count and Frank from fighting; anything
but that!”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake get rid of De Mürger. He
is so <i>embroiling</i>,” counseled Jacynth.</p>

<p>“How can I? After bringing him here a long
journey to-day, can I whistle him away to-morrow?”
she responds with naïve indignation. “It
is as bad as putting back the bottle-imp.”</p>

<p>“Then you—some of us must leave. The situation
is too strained.”</p>

<p>“You advise flight; and I, who am just spoiling
for a fight, as the Irish say——” she was actually
laughing again, it was too bad.</p>

<p>“If you will stay, let me make you acquainted
with my sister Helen, Grandison’s mother,” said
Jacynth softly, pity stirring his heart-strings for
this young creature. “She is a good sort—a
genuine woman.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Fenella absently, looking
round. “What is the count about; and where is
Ronny?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>

BY F. C. PHILLIPS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning Jacynth called upon his sister
and explained to her that he wished her to
extend a helping hand to Lady Francis Onslow.
He had told Fenella that his sister Helen was “a
good sort—a genuine woman,” and he was, therefore,
disagreeably surprised when he found the
view that lady took of the situation.</p>

<p>“Lady Francis Onslow?” she said, raising her
eyebrows. “She is separated from her husband,
is she not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it is not her fault,” answered Jacynth
quickly. “Onslow treated her very badly.”</p>

<p>“I remember something about it,” said his sister.
“I think there was a kind of shuffling of the
cards and a new deal. Lord Francis took up with
a Frenchwoman and his wife consoled herself
with M. de Mürger. Is not that the story?”</p>

<p>“It is a garbled account of it. Lady Francis
was perfectly innocent,” said Jacynth hotly.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt, but all the same I think I
would rather have nothing to say to her. It is
always a foolish thing to interfere between husband
and wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“I do not ask for your interference, Helen,”
said her brother. “I merely ask you to let me
introduce you to Lady Francis, and I should like
you to be kind to her.”</p>

<p>“Why are you interested in her?”</p>

<p>“Because I think she has been badly treated,
and because she is an impulsive, reckless little
woman who will benefit much from your advice.”</p>

<p>“I dislike impulsive, reckless little women,”
said Helen, “and I would much rather not know
her.”</p>

<p>“You are very unkind, dear, and quite unlike
your usual self. Lady Francis has got herself
into a fix, and you must really get her out of it—to
please me.”</p>

<p>“What fix has she got herself into?”</p>

<p>“Well, I will tell you. Her husband is here, as
of course you know, and immediately after his
arrival Mme. de Vigny appeared on the scene.
Poor Lady Francis, who is naturally outraged at
his conduct, telegraphed to De Mürger to come
down, and this will, of course, make things look
black for her if you do not give her your help and
moral support. She does not know any ladies
here, and of course she has acted imprudently.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she has acted imprudently and stupidly.
It only confirms my impression that I would
rather not know her,” said his sister.</p>

<p>“But, Helen, she is very young, and she has no
one to advise her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“She has you to advise her,” laughed Helen;
“and as you are a clever, rising barrister, I should
have thought you would have been wise enough
to have prevented her telegraphing for her
lover.”</p>

<p>“He is not her lover,” shouted Jacynth loudly.</p>

<p>“As to her extreme youth,” pursued his sister,
unmoved at his interruption, “she has a child old
enough to play cricket on the green with the
tinkers and the tailors and the butcher boys of
the place. She must surely be out of her teens!
And if she does not know how to behave herself
now, I am afraid she never will.”</p>

<p>“Why are you so hard, Helen?” he asked,
looking at his sister in surprise.</p>

<p>“I am not hard,” she answered, “but I really
fail to see why you require my aid. Lady Francis
seems quite able to take care of herself. The
fact is, Clitheroe,” she continued, “you must
know as well as I do that the <i>lex talionis</i> does not
apply to husbands and wives. It is only in quite
the lower classes that the wife throws back the
sugar basin at her husband when he has aimed at
her with the teapot. Men have a certain license
with regard to flirtation which has always been
denied to women. It may be wrong—I daresay
it is—but I am not going to head any movement
to bring about a change.”</p>

<p>“I think she would listen to you if you would
ask her to send M. de Mürger back to town,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Jacynth. “As it is, they fear there may be a
duel.”</p>

<p>“And you want me to mix myself up in all
this unsavory business?” she exclaimed. “Really,
Clitheroe, you are very unreasonable.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry for Lady Francis,” he said, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>“And I suppose you are in love with her.
Nothing else could explain your strange persistency.
You are very foolish, and you are
wasting your time. If the woman cares for anyone,
I suppose it is for her curly-headed attaché.
It is evident that you are only being made use of,
and I am certainly not going to follow your ridiculous
example. Lady Francis possesses no possible
interest for me. I consider her unladylike,
wanting in <i>savoir vivre</i> and tact, and quite the
last person for whom I could have any sympathy.”</p>

<p>“She has been cruelly treated,” said Jacynth.</p>

<p>“So have thousands of other women, but they
manage to bear their cruel treatment and behave
with better taste than Lady Francis.”</p>

<p>“What am I to say to her?” said Clitheroe,
almost angrily. “She is waiting in the garden.
I told her that you would call upon her this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Then you took a very unwarrantable liberty,”
said his sister. “I will not call upon her. I
should advise you to tell her to send De Mürger
away at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“And then will you call upon her?” he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” answered his sister. “I detest
fuzzy-headed little women who get on well with
any man except their husband. There will be an
<i>esclandre</i> one day, and I don’t mean to be mixed
up in it.”</p>

<p>“I had no idea you were so uncharitable,” he
said, with genuine surprise.</p>

<p>“I am not the least uncharitable,” she said;
“but you must admit that Lady Francis has
everything against her.”</p>

<p>“Appearances may be against her,” he said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“And appearances in society count for everything,”
said his sister. “If women wish to be
original, and what you call reckless and impulsive,
they must give up society, for you may be quite
sure that they will meet with the cold shoulder
wherever they go.”</p>

<p>“You have certainly shown it to Lady Francis,”
he said bitterly.</p>

<p>“For the reason I have told you. As for your
sentimental rubbish about her ill-treatment from
her husband, she cannot have suffered so very
dreadfully, as she has always had Count de
Mürger to console her.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Helen; you have said quite
enough. I am sorry I attempted to enlist your
sympathy, and I am doubly sorry that I mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
you to Lady Francis. I don’t know what
I shall say to her. You have placed me in a very
awkward position.”</p>

<p>“You have placed yourself in one,” she said.
“Why not leave Harrogate at once? You are
only being made a tool of, and you had better
let the <i>partie carrée</i> sort itself as best it may.”</p>

<p>Jacynth felt terribly perplexed, and he could
scarcely help feeling that there was a certain
amount of truth—a certain amount of worldly
wisdom—in what his sister had said. Of course
Fenella did not care for him, and never would.
Everyone had warned him against her, and it was
very foolish of him to indulge a wild dream which
could never be anything but a wild dream. He
was perfectly convinced of her innocence with
respect to De Mürger, but evidently it was difficult
to get others to share his credulity. And
why should they believe that she was innocent
when she allowed the man to come and stay in
the hotel with her, in defiance, not only of her
husband’s wishes, but also of all the laws of society
and good taste? His sister’s words had been
very severe and uncompromising, but he almost
felt as if he must agree with her, and this feeling
added to his annoyance and depression.</p>

<p>What could he say to the poor, little, misguided
woman who was waiting for him to extricate
her from her difficulties? How could he possibly
explain to her that his sister had refused to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
make her acquaintance when he had told her that
she might count upon her assistance and sympathy?
He walked out of the house in a furious
frame of mind. He was angry with his sister,
and still more so with himself for being influenced
by what she had said. He went straight
to his rendezvous with Lady Francis, and when
she caught sight of him she started up and came
forward with outstretched hands. At once his
doubts disappeared. It only needed one look
from her pleading brown eyes for all his old confidence
and infatuation to be restored.</p>

<p>“How kind you are!” said Fenella, with gratitude
beaming in her face. “Have you been all
this time with your sister? When am I to see her?”</p>

<p>Then Jacynth felt extremely uncomfortable,
and looked down and kicked about the gravel,
unable to answer the questions which were put to
him.</p>

<p>“What did your sister say?” pursued Fenella.
“Did you explain everything to her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I explained everything,” he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>“But not so well as I can explain it,” she continued,
and then, “I am sure I shall like your
sister—that is to say, if she is like you.”</p>

<p>“She is not like me,” he said moodily. “She is
altogether different.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she said brightly; “I shall like
her all the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“I am afraid——” he began.</p>

<p>“Yes? What are you afraid of?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You see, my sister is going away very shortly;
in fact, she may leave any day,” he answered
confusedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry,” she said simply.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he continued desperately, “and, of
course, as her stay here is going to be so very
short, she thinks—I mean she fears——”</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” said Fenella calmly.</p>

<p>“She fears that she could not be of much
assistance to you.”</p>

<p>“But I myself am not going to stay long,” she
said. “But it will be very kind of her to let me
see something of her before she leaves. It will
silence the evil tongues.”</p>

<p>“She feels that it will be scarcely worth while
to make your acquaintance,” said Jacynth, with a
final violent kick at the gravel.</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Fenella, in altogether a
different voice, and the light went out of her face.</p>

<p>“I can assure you——” said Jacynth, but Fenella
stopped him.</p>

<p>“You need say no more,” she said. “Your
sister refuses to know me. I daresay she is
right.”</p>

<p>Then there was an awkward silence. Jacynth
could find no excuses ready, and Fenella was inwardly
very indignant. At last she managed to
subdue her emotion sufficiently to say to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“I must thank you for the effort you have
made on my behalf; you have been very kind,
and whatever happens to me, I will never forget
your kindness.”</p>

<p>Jacynth still found nothing to say, and, scarcely
before he had realized it, Fenella had turned from
him and was hastily running toward the hotel.</p>

<div class="verse">I never think but to regret</div>
<div class="verse">I know too much——</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hush and silence had fallen over the outer
world beyond and about the great hotel, and
something of its hush and mystery brooded too
in the deserted corridors and vacated public
rooms of the building itself. Perhaps one or two
of its inmates—so strangely thrown together—would
have given almost every earthly possession
for the power to gaze unknown—unseen—into
one of those locked chambers; a room where a
woman sat alone, with all the light and laughter
and mischief gone from her face, and the shadows
of suffering and regret resting like somber memories
in her veiled and sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p>This was not Lady Francis as the world knew
her—as the men whom she bewitched and tormented
and flirted with in so audacious a fashion
knew her. No, this was a woman maddened by
self-reproach and unavailing regrets, fired with
jealous hatred of a rival, and filled to the heart’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
core with the memories and the longings that one
voice, one face, alone in all the world had power
to awaken, and had awakened to-day.</p>

<p>She had thrown on a loose muslin wrapper, and
the soft lace and pale tinted ribbons seemed to
cling lovingly around the lissom figure, the snowy
throat and arms. The long glass opposite reflected
her as she raised her drooping head with
its wreath of unbound hair, and the sorrowful
eyes that met her own struck sharply on her
senses as a surprise—so unlike they were to the
eyes she was used to see. “Oh, what a fool I
have been,” she cried, with an impatience and
intolerance of herself that was the more maddening
by reason of its vain remorse. “And yet I
suppose I should do it again to-morrow under the
same circumstances; yet, O Frank, Frank, how
I loved you once—how you <i>seemed</i> to love me!”</p>

<p>She looked down again at the table by which
she was seated. On it lay an open photograph
case containing a photograph. The dark eyes
smiled at her—the handsome, gay, young face
looked radiant in its happy youth and supreme
content with life.</p>

<p>Her own intent gaze seemed to drink in thirstily
every line, every feature, well as she knew
them all. “He doesn’t look happy—now,” she
said, and a little sob broke from her.</p>

<p>Impatiently she closed the case, and began to
pace up and down the room in a stormy, impetuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
fashion—dashing the tears from her wet lashes,
though they only thronged back fast and swift in
very mockery of her efforts to deny their weakness.</p>

<p>“How could I expect it to be different? Isn’t
it always the same—always, always?” she repeated
passionately. “Love doesn’t last; it can’t.
And there were so many temptations; and then
the excitement of conquest, and the vanity of
wishing to show him I could still charm others,
though he seemed to think I had no right to try.
But it was all so false, so—so foolish. If he had
only trusted, if he had only spoken gently,
kindly—as he used to speak! And then that
hateful woman, that French serpent—fiend—adventuress.
Heavens! how I hated her; how I
hate her still. If I thought he cared, <i>really</i>
cared—if I thought he had ever held her to his
heart—kissed her as he used to kiss me—if—oh!
I could <i>kill</i> her!”</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly, pressing her hand to
her heart, while the blood rushed in a crimson
torrent to her face. “Oh! he can’t!” she moaned,
throwing herself face downward on the cushions
of the couch. “And yet I believed it—once; and
I’ve never even let any man’s lips touch my hand;
never, with all my whims and follies and vagaries,
allowed myself to forget that I am Frank’s wife.
But he doesn’t care any longer. How could I
expect it? And yet if he had only spoken one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
word to-day—one little word, I would have
thrown myself at his feet and said, ‘O Frank, I
love you—I’ve never ceased loving you. Oh!
take me back and let us forget all this miserable
mistake.’ Frank!” She raised her head and
shook back the rich, soft hair impatiently, and
stretched longing arms out to the empty silence.
“Frank,” she whispered more loudly, “why don’t
you come to me? Why don’t you feel I want
you as—as surely—sometimes—you want me.
Frank——”</p>

<p>She rose unsteadily, supporting herself by one
hand that rested on the back of the couch.</p>

<p>Her face had grown strangely white, her eyes
had a look of intensity that spoke of strained
mental force. “If I dared go to him,” she said,
still in that strange whisper. “I’ve never said I
was wrong—or—or sorry, but I am, Frank—God
knows I am. Don’t drive me desperate; I’m too
unhappy and too reckless to be always patient.
But if you swear you never loved any other
woman, Frank, I—I will swear I never loved or
thought of any man save you. Never, dear
heart—never.”</p>

<p>Still with that strained look, intense and far off
as that of a sleepwalker, still with face deathlike
in its rigid whiteness, she moved across the room.
The loose shower of hair seemed to annoy her by
its weight. She paused an instant before the
table and took up a curious-looking silver dagger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Then, hastily twisting the hair into a thick coil,
she fastened it with the dagger and turned toward
the door.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Will she read it?” muttered Lord Francis to
himself, as he looked at the closely-covered pages
of the letter in his hand. “Oh, if she would only
believe, if she would only let me know what she
really feels. It is maddening to be placed in such
a position, to see her playing fast and loose with
reputation, to have no more right to kiss her lips
or touch her hand than the veriest stranger. To
be here now, to-night, the same roof covering us,
not half a dozen walls dividing us, and yet not
dare——”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, his eyes grew dark with
stormy passions. The pain and fever of aroused
memories throbbed wildly in his heart, and
thrilled his veins anew with love and longing, as
once her light step and sweet low laugh had
thrilled him.</p>

<p>“Fenella! wife!” his heart cried. “O God!
are our lives to be forever wrecked and spoiled
by this miserable folly? Child, surely you know
I love you, that all other women are but as shadows
to me. Oh, how my heart aches for you!
Surely you feel it—you can’t have forgotten—you
<i>can’t</i>!”</p>

<p>He looked again at the letter, then placed it in
an envelope and sealed it hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“I will go to her—I know her room. I can
slip it under the door if—if she is asleep; but,
perhaps——”</p>

<p>He did not finish that thought audibly. Only
opened the door and looked down the dark and
silent corridor beyond.</p>

<p>How still it was. He heard a clock striking,
somewhere in the silence, two hours after midnight.
A strange chill—a feeling of half shame,
half uncertainty—held him there on the threshold.
There seemed something guilty and wrong
about the simple action he intended.</p>

<p>“To think,” he muttered to himself, “that a
man should actually feel there was something
improper in leaving a letter at his own wife’s
door. Yet, if I were seen, who would believe it?”</p>

<p>He drew the door after him. The whole corridor
was in darkness. At the further end stood a
marble statue surrounded by tall palms. He had
noticed it already during the day. The room
next to it was the one he had seen Lady Francis
enter.</p>

<p>He moved softly down the long passage. Suddenly
he paused, and shrank back into a doorway
close at hand. That door beside the statue and
the palms was thrown open; a slender white figure
stood revealed by the light within the room.
At the same moment another figure—the figure
of a man—advanced rapidly, and spoke in a low,
hurried voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>The watcher stood as if turned to stone. He
saw the woman retreat backward step by step
into the room she had just quitted. He saw the
man attempt to follow her. The door shut;
again all was darkness and silence.</p>

<p>For one hateful, throbbing moment, that
seemed to hold a lifetime of agony in its passage,
Lord Francis stood there, gazing at the closed
door. At last, with trembling limbs and face
bloodless as the dead, he staggered back to his
own room, and sank down on the chair where he
had written that letter, with its pleading for love
and reconciliation.</p>

<p>“Too late!” he cried. “O Heaven! to think
my own eyes should be the witness of my own
eternal shame and—hers!”</p>

<p>His head fell on his arms. He was as one
dazed and stunned by the consciousness of misery
undreamt of, despite those cold and silent
years.</p>

<p>Moment after moment passed. One hour and
then another dropped into the gulf of time that
is no more. Still he never stirred. Consciousness
of anything besides his own misery—besides
the living recognition of his own shame—was
dead within him; dead as youth was dead, and
hope, and truth, and all things fair and sweet in
life—slain by a woman’s hand.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The dawn was brightening into daylight as at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
last Lord Francis roused himself from his long
stupor.</p>

<p>“What had happened?” he thought confusedly.
“Had he been ill? Had he done anything?”</p>

<p>A hideous dread seized and appalled him. In
those brief hours he seemed to have lived a lifetime.</p>

<p>“Why did I not kill him?” he muttered, lifting
his haggard young face up to the faint rose light
that filtered through the curtains. “Kill him!
aye, and in her arms—kill him and her too!
Heaven!” a strange, hoarse laugh escaped him.</p>

<p>“I shall go mad if I stay here—under the same
roof with them.”</p>

<p>He began to move about confusedly, putting
things together, and tossing his clothes into his
portmanteau. He was possessed but by one
idea—to leave a place made hateful by this discovery,
to get away from these men and women,
with their jeering tongues and malicious smiles,
who all guessed or knew of his disgrace. It had
been so public, so shameless. She had summoned
this man to her side. She had flaunted
her preference for him before his very face, and
now——</p>

<p>He cursed her in his heart, as still, with
fevered haste and strange, impetuous movements,
he gathered together his few possessions. Then
he locked his box and wrote a hurried note to the
manager of the hotel, inclosing a check and stating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
that the portmanteau would be sent for later
on. A hurried glance around—a glance which
passed over the letter he had written but a few
brief hours before. It lay where it had fallen
from his hand when he sank into the chair by his
writing-table—lay there so innocent, yet so
fraught with power to work remorse or retribution
in days that were to come.</p>

<p>The gray light of the early dawn gleamed like
a pale phosphorescence over the shadowy corridor,
and lit with spectral mystery the white
statue and the dusky palms. He shuddered as
his eyes fell on them. How significant they had
become.</p>

<p>Then, with a smothered oath that breathed
vengeance for the future, he rushed down the
staircase and past the sleeping porter in the
entrance hall, and in another moment was standing
in the fresh, sweet atmosphere of life and
light that God and Nature have so freely given to
the thankless, sated eyes of men.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>How that day passed Lord Francis never
knew. It seemed to him, when his senses grew
clearer, that weeks and months must have gone
by since that awful moment that had brought to
him the full and complete knowledge of his wife’s
perfidy. Yet there had been a strange and consistent
purpose in all his actions. He had walked
for miles and miles before taking the train. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
had reached London, and driven straight to his
chambers, to the no small dismay and discomfiture
of his man, who had been inaugurating a
brief spell of leisure not as wisely as he might
have done. He had given orders to this man to
pack up clothes sufficient for a long journey, paid
his wages, arranged with his usual caretaker to
remain in the chambers, then departed for Charing
Cross to catch the tidal train <i>en route</i> for Paris.</p>

<p>All this he remembered afterward. Remembered
vaguely, impassively, as if every action had
been performed by someone apart and outside of
himself; as if he had been spectator instead of
actor. Remembered, even as he remembered the
crowded station, the flashing lights, the hoarse
cries of the porters, the bustle and confusion on
the platform, and high above all the shrill voice
of the newsvendors crying out the news of the
evening papers—“<i>Pall Mall!</i>” “<i>St. James Gazette!</i>”
or “<i>Star!</i> Latest edition! Mysterious
murder of a foreign count in a hotel! Latest
special!”</p>

<p>He threw himself back on the seat of his carriage.
What mattered murders or tragedies to
him? In heart he knew himself a murderer by
desire and fierce hatred—in reality, his life had
turned to tragedy deep and bitter and terrible,
with a hopelessness that the coming years could
never brighten, and the dawn of Hope would
never bless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>The shrill whistle of the engine sounded above
all the clamor. The train moved slowly out of
the station, and still clear and distinct those
words reached him like a meaningless echo:
“Murder of a foreign count! Mysterious occurrence!
Special edition! Special edition!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br>

BY JOSEPH HATTON.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">Out, out, damned spot!—<i>Shakspere.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was during these hours that had “dropped
one by one into the gulf of time” that the miserable
count had been done to death by as fierce a
murderer as had ever mutilated Nature’s handiwork,
albeit unconscious of his sanguinary deed.
While mind and body had, so far as Lord Francis
knew, been absorbed in sleep, both had been
cruelly awake under a strange mesmeric or electro-biologic
influence.</p>

<p>The wrong by which his soul was vexed had
carried him out of himself, and brought him under
the control of what unsophisticated people call
sleep-walking, with suicidal or murderous impulse.
Scientists have found in this hypnological condition
new examples of unconscious evolution of
the mind; but it is not our business to describe
or investigate the various discoveries which, in the
direction of hypnotic trance or mesmeric constraint,
have of late occupied public attention; we
have merely to record the facts that in this present
history are stranger than fiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Illustrations of the possibilities of a dual existence
have been given to the world in the case of
<i>Hyde</i> and <i>Jekyll</i>, but sleep-walking is as old as
the hills, and give the hypnological subject the
original impulse of a bitter wrong sufficient to
excite a vengeful desire, then such a deed as that
which was proclaimed by the newsboys, as Lord
Francis left his chambers to take the tidal train
to Paris, is quite conceivable.</p>

<p>The victim of the dream in action, the sleepwalker—the
subject of the mesmerizer—comes
out of his trance oblivious of his hypnotic adventures.</p>

<p>And thus it was with Lord Francis. But what
a crime he had unconsciously committed! And
with what heroic self-denial the wife had taken
upon herself all the responsibility of the criminal’s
vengeful act!</p>

<p>The male figure which Lord Francis had seen
stealing toward his wife’s room was the Count de
Mürger. In this Lord Francis was not mistaken,
but Fenella was. We know how at the moment
her heart was yearning for its rightful lord, but
De Mürger little thought that Lady Francis
had taken him for Frank. Her feelings had been
so wrought up to the pitch of hope, that leaving
her room to find her husband and throw herself
at his feet, she fancied him in a similar frame of
mind—as indeed he was—and love interpreted
the approach of the count into that of her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Alas! if she had only resented the presence of
the count in the hearing of Lord Francis; if he
could have heard the overwhelming rebuke of the
true wife as the truculent lover flung himself
upon his knees before her, what a world of misery
had been spared him and her!</p>

<p>Not that the death of the count was any loss
to society or the world; it was not. There was
no redeeming feature in his character. He had
worked his way into Fenella’s confidence by
subtle lies; he had won his position in society,
such as it was, by the meanest arts; not to mention
the replenishing of his purse on more than
one occasion by doubtful play at cards, even
when invited to the best houses. In short, the
count was an unscrupulous man, but he was fascinating
to women, and could boast, and did, of
his many conquests.</p>

<p>Such perfidy as this may be successful for a
time, but it not unfrequently has a violent ending.</p>

<p>In the case of Count de Mürger his career was
cut short at the moment when he was, as he
thought, on the eve of his most daring and villainous
success. If his death cast a shadow upon
the reputation of Fenella, since it occurred in her
chamber, it threw around her the halo of a wifely
devotion not unworthy of the classic days of
classic virtue.</p>

<p>It is only the reader, however, of the present
history who can understand all that is meant by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
this revelation of wifely atonement and love.
Fenella, like many another wife, had sought to
amuse herself with a would-be lover; she had
also played him off against the supposed indifference
of her husband in a careless rivalry of his
harmless flirtations.</p>

<p>When the police entered the chamber of Lady
Francis Onslow, they found the count lying dead
on the floor. Looking to her for some explanation,
she drew herself to her full height, and,
flinging upon the body the silver-hilted dagger
she had worn in her hair, she said, “This man
attempted my life, and I killed him.”</p>

<p>It is curious how situations of a kindred character
often inspire similar explanation. It will
be remembered by many that when the deputy
in “The Dead Heart” drew the attention of the
guard to the dead Abbé, he did so in words quite
similar to those used by Lady Onslow.</p>

<p>It was a most pathetic figure—the slim, pale
woman, as she drew her brocaded gown about her
and fixed her expressive eyes on the police.</p>

<p>Lord Francis Onslow little dreamed of what
had occurred as he fled from the hotel. And
yet it was he whom his wife was shielding in her
strange confession. It was Lord Francis himself
who had slain the count, and in her presence.</p>

<p>It is known that great discoveries have been
made during so-called sleep. Men have made
long journeys in their dreams, and awakened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
unconscious of their travels. Others have arisen
refreshed with a new sense of knowledge and
power. Louis Stevenson has confessed that he
dreams his stories, and then writes them out.
There was in a recent Academy the picture of a
young girl walking with closed eyes amid poppies
and hemlocks. The present writer has experienced,
in his own career, an incident of hypnotic
sleep or mesmeric trance, during which he went
forth in very truth with knife and pistol to commit,
as it seemed, some great crime, and was only
prevented by the kindly guidance of a loving arm,
that held his own and led him back to the couch
from which he had risen.</p>

<p>And thus it was when Lord Francis exclaimed,
“Too late! O Heaven! to think my own eyes
should be witness of my own eternal shame, and—hers,”
the hand of Fate was stretched out
against the intriguing and vicious Count de Mürger.
For as Lord Francis staggered back to his
room, dazed, stunned, the cold tears welling up
into his eyes, his head on his arms, his whole
form limp with shattered nerves, a new and terrible
power was created within him. He fell into
a chair, entirely overcome, and for a little while
appeared to sleep. But it was the sleep that
awakens, the mesmeric sleep that walks and acts,
the dream-sleep that takes possession of body and
mind; such sleep as that which afflicted <i>Lady
Macbeth</i> after the murder of <i>Duncan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>Hardly had De Mürger surprised the startled
Fenella than Lord Francis arose from the chair
and retraced his steps toward his wife’s room.
While all that he knew of himself was asleep,
Nature, in one of its strangest freaks, propelled
him forth.</p>

<p>“Back, sir! How dare you come here?” Lady
Francis was exclaiming as he entered the room.</p>

<p>De Mürger had just risen from his knees, and
in Fenella’s hand, raised above her head, was a
gleaming dagger.</p>

<p>“But, my dear Fenella, listen,” said the count.</p>

<p>“Back, I say! Touch me, and I will kill you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is foolish bravado,” the Frenchman
answered.</p>

<p>“Another word, and I will alarm the house.”</p>

<p>“That would only be to ruin your reputation,”
said the daring lover.</p>

<p>“God knows I have not much reputation to lose
in the eyes of the world, since it seems I have
given you sufficient encouragement to bring you
here.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, why be cruel now? You know I
love you dearly!” As he made this last appeal,
Fenella stood transfixed, her eyes no longer upon
his, but gazing, as it seemed, on vacancy.</p>

<p>“Hush,” she whispered, her eyes fixed, her figure
rigid with fear.</p>

<p>She saw her husband steal ghostlike into the
room; noted his blanched face, his lips blue, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
eyes piercing bright. He seemed to glide
toward her like an animal creeping upon its
prey.</p>

<p>“Ah, you relent,” said the count, approaching
her with loving action, at which the apparition of
the avenging husband paused. For a moment
Lady Francis thought it was an apparition, the
unreal creation of her fears; but as it came
crouching on again as if ready to spring, she realized
the dreadful situation, and in response to the
count in his fool’s paradise, she whispered, “Hush!
your hour has come, and mine. And, O Heaven,
he will never know I am innocent!”</p>

<p>The next moment the stealthy figure rose up
and seemed to smite the count as an anaconda
might. There was no noise, no thudding blow;
but a great iron grip held him by the throat, and in
a moment later the dagger was taken from the
hand of Lady Francis and was thrust into the
heart of the already dying man.</p>

<p>Presently the deed was done, and the murderer
stood face to face with his wife. He looked at
her as if he saw her not. She spoke; he did not
seem to hear her.</p>

<p>“I am innocent, Frank,” she said, “but oh, kill
me, too; for you can never believe me. I was
seeking you when he came to me; I had upbraided
myself, and determined to ask your forgiveness
for my neglect of you. But oh! for
nothing more, as Heaven is my judge! But kill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
me; you can never again think me a true and
honest wife.”</p>

<p>For a moment the somnambulist stood and
gazed at her, but surely saw her not.</p>

<p>“He is mad!” she said, “mad! Or have I lost
my senses? Frank, Frank, I will save you! Begone!
I am to blame! I will accept the responsibility!
Begone!”</p>

<p>She did not move as she spoke, nor did he.
They both looked steadily at each other. She
thought he was about to answer her, when he
moved away, retracing his steps from the room as
stealthily as he had entered it. She watched him
with a strange fascination, and without the power
to move until he disappeared; and then, with a
moaning cry, she sank upon her knees and put out
her hand toward the ghastly heap upon the floor,
in the hope that she was only dreaming, and that
all she had seen was mere fantasy; but the carpet
was wet, and there was blood upon her hand.</p>

<p>“Why did I not kill him!” he had exclaimed,
as we know, when he had returned to his own
room and passed out of his sleep to life and consciousness.</p>

<p>He knew nothing of the murderous scene in
which he had played so terrible a part—knew
nothing of the crumpled, bleeding body lying in
a hideous heap, with its pale companion looking
down upon it, and the light piercing in through
the curtained window with ghostlike fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Fenella watched the first sentinels of the morning,
pointing airy fingers here and there; one
trembling sun-glance falling upon the silver hilt
of the red dagger; another seeking, as it were, to
find out the hideous face of the dead man. But
she uttered no word, only stood there still and
quiet, like some strangely sculptured statue waiting
to be called to life—as she was presently
called by an inspector of police and the manager
of the hotel after she had given the alarm.</p>

<p>Aroused to action, she took upon herself all the
odium of her husband’s deed—took it upon herself
with the queen-like dignity of an avenging
angel.</p>

<p>“This man attempted my life, and I killed
him!”</p>

<p>And they knew, those common men, that when
she said her life she meant her honor. To her
that was her life, and they were conscious of her
great beauty, even as she stood before them, pale
as a ghost, and with hot, burning eyes.</p>

<p>The officer noticed that there was no evidence
of a struggle; not a curtain was awry, no chair
was out of its place, the carpet was unruffled, the
room was neat and trim as if nothing unusual
had taken place. Before touching the body, he
wrote these facts down in his book. Then, laying
his hand upon the bundle of clothes, he exposed
the dead face of the count, and requested
the hotel manager to admit his two attendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
constables. One he dispatched for a doctor; to
the other he confided the custody of Lady Francis
Onslow.</p>

<p>“I charge you formally, madam, with the murder
of this man on your own confession, which I
have written down, and I warn you that anything
else you may say will be given in evidence against
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Fenella, “he attempted my life,
and I killed him.”</p>

<p>“You are my prisoner, my lady,” said the inspector;
“but you may call in any friend you
wish to see. At the same time, I again warn you
that anything you may say will be taken down
and may be given in evidence against you. I
will do my duty as considerately as possible, but
I have a duty to perform, and that of course you
will understand.”</p>

<p>The first editions of the newspapers gave conflicting
reports of the count’s death.</p>

<p>For a time the public did not understand
whether the count had been murdered in his bed
by burglars, whether he was the victim of Nihilistic
vengeance, or whether he had committed
suicide; but on the morning following the tragedy
they were regaled with all the strange story and
much more besides.</p>

<p>The confession of Lady Francis Onslow was a
text upon which everybody had a sermon to
preach. But it was speedily a point of comment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
that the marks upon the throat of the dead man
suggested a more powerful grip than that of
Fenella. There was something in the condition
of the body which puzzled the experts. This
was no ordinary murder, everybody agreed; nor
indeed was it, as we know.</p>

<p>At the inquest the medical testimony showed
that death might have been caused either by
strangulation or by the various stabbings that
disfigured the body.</p>

<p>It seemed to the experts that the man had
been done to death by some person far more
powerful than the prisoner. The marks on the
throat were almost as strong, and the bruises and
depression of the windpipe as great, as would be
caused by hanging. The man had been gripped
by a powerful hand, while the stabs had been
given with a force that had left the impression of
the handle upon the flesh. The witnesses were
few, but they were sufficient to show that a murder
had been committed, though the jury and the
public had evidently grave doubts about the
criminality of the prisoner, Lady Francis Onslow.</p>

<p>One of the jurors had asked a pointed question
as to the possibility of the deceased having committed
suicide. This was, however, only a kindly
suggestion in the direction of Lady Francis Onslow’s
innocence. The count had been killed by
other hands than his own. There was no doubt
about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>What irritated the public in regard to the first
day’s inquiry was that, while there were hints at
scandal, nothing came out that might be called
piquant.</p>

<p>Of course, there was the fact that the count
was in Lady Onslow’s bedroom at midnight; but
none of the details that led up to this piece of
audacity—if it were audacity—were disclosed.</p>

<p>The coroner, in a mild rebuke administered to
the foreman of the jury, said the court was
assembled to inquire into the death of Count de
Mürger, but it was not a court of social investigation;
it was not an inquisition charged with a
mission to unravel scandal or to exploit the life
and manners of a section of Her Majesty’s subjects.
While he would take any evidence that
bore upon the case, however painful that evidence
might be to the private feelings or public
reputation of even the highest in the land, he
would not allow that court to be unduly inquisitorial
in matters that could only satisfy the prurient
and licentious taste of that wretched section
of the public which found its chief amusement in
French novels and the scandals of Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>Poor coroner! he lived to regret those words.
Even some of the very best newspapers condemned
them; and the worst called for the coroner’s
instant dismissal, as a panderer to the aristocracy
and unfit to preside over a court of any
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>On the first day of the inquest the coroner
asked why Lord Francis Onslow was not present.
The question created an expectant hush, which
was maintained while Mr. Jarrow Cook, of the
firm of Cook, Son &amp; Lovett, the family lawyers
of the Onslows, explained that Lord Francis was
somewhere abroad—where, they did not know.</p>

<p>“When did Lord Francis quit the hotel where
the count was killed?” asked the foreman of the
jury.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” was the lawyer’s reply.</p>

<p>“I believe he left very early and suddenly for
London, and then went on to Paris. Is that so?”</p>

<p>“I really cannot say,” was the lawyer’s answer.</p>

<p>“I do not know that these questions are in
order, Mr. Foreman,” said the coroner.</p>

<p>“May be not, Mr. Coroner,” replied the foreman,
“but there is a good deal, it strikes me, in
the conduct of Lord Francis Onslow in this matter
that requires explanation.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Coroner,” said the lawyer, “if you will
permit me to say so, Lord Francis will, I am
quite sure, be quite ready to answer any questions
that this honorable court may desire to ask
him; but I think in his absence that——”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the coroner, interrupting Mr.
Jarrow Cook, of the firm of Cook, Son &amp; Lovett.
“I am sure the foreman will feel that it is not
within our province at the moment to refer to the
conduct of Lord Francis Onslow. His lordship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
will, no doubt, present himself before us in due
course, if wanted. If necessary, I will order his
attendance.”</p>

<p>At this there was some applause in court, and
Mr. Jarrow Cook rose to remark with all deference
that he thought the coroner’s observation
uncalled for, whereupon the coroner reminded
Mr. Jarrow Cook that he was only there by
courtesy, and that he must request him not to
offer any further criticism of a personal nature in
regard to the conduct of the court.</p>

<p>Mr. Jarrow Cook bowed, and the proceedings
went on without any further interruption.</p>

<p>The prisoner, who was dressed in a quiet gown
of gray cashmere, sat placidly in an armchair near
Mr. Jarrow Cook. She was pale, but quite self-possessed.
The evidence of the police inspector
seemed to interest her very much, as he related
with careful regard to detail how he was sent for,
and what he saw and heard in the prisoner’s
room; how he cautioned her, and what he said
when he took her into custody.</p>

<p>An observant reporter thought he detected a
peculiar smile pass over the mobile features of
Lady Francis Onslow, when the first medical witness
suggested the impossibility of a woman having
made the marks on the throat of the dead
man; but no doubt, when the case comes to be
sifted to its very dregs, and the prosecuting counsel
has to reply to this medical criticism, he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
be able to adduce instances of the enormous
strength that comes with passion, or is the outcome
of some great act of revenge, and so on.</p>

<p>That is, if Lady Francis Onslow should have to
take her trial for willful murder, though the coroner’s
inquest ended with her condemnation, the
case has still to go before the police magistrate,
and already public opinion has decided that if
Lady Francis Onslow did kill the would-be Tarquin
she is only guilty of manslaughter. By her
own confession, upon which she was originally
charged, the man sought her life, and she killed
him. It was remarked by many that in America
she would have easily found bail if she had been
arrested, and that if she had ever come before a
court for trial she would have been promptly
acquitted. “Justifiable homicide” is a verdict
not unknown to the English law, many wise persons
also remarked.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lady Francis Onslow was on her
way in a police van, to be charged in the police
court, and a detective had been told off at Scotland
Yard to keep his eye upon Lord Francis
Onslow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br>

BY MRS. LOVETT CAMERON.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
Shall be lifted—Nevermore!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> was free—free to go where she pleased—to
do as she liked. The hideous nightmare of
the trial was over; a jury of her countrymen
had brought in a verdict of “Justifiable homicide.”
The laws of her country had given her
back her liberty, and Fenella was a free woman.</p>

<p>Perhaps the jury had not been altogether unimpressed
by the pale loveliness of the unhappy
girl who had stood before them as “prisoner in
the dock” during those two terrible days; perhaps
the sight of the small pale face, of the
piteous brown eyes, of the childish rosy lips that
quivered a little, yet that never swerved in that
one statement that they repeated through all
the weary examination and cross-examination,
may have influenced those rough men, who held
her life in their hands, more than they had any
idea of.</p>

<p>“I confess it. I killed him; he attempted my
life; and I killed him in self-defense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“When you say your life, you mean probably
more, do you not?” inquired the barrister who
was examining her; and she answered him simply,
“I do—I mean that which to a woman is dearer
than life itself;” and at the words a sort of shiver
of suppressed excitement ran through that packed
and crowded court—a shiver that made as though
one heart-throb of sympathy and of admiration.
But more than all else did Fenella owe her salvation
to the man who stood up for a whole
hour to defend her.</p>

<p>Clitheroe Jacynth, it was said afterward, made
his professional reputation over the defense of
Lady Francis Onslow. He had been known to
be clever, he had been reckoned among the rising
men of his day, but never until now had the
world quite realized the power that was in him.
He had all the eloquence, the fire, the passionate
pleading of a man whose whole soul was in the
cause that he advocated, and his arguments carried
all before them by the sheer force of will and
talent. No one who saw the dark, passionate
face—the eyes that shone with righteous wrath—who
listened to the strong, sinuous words that
seemed to burn into the hearts of his hearers as
they fell, like living fire, from his lips, ever forgot
Jacynth as he was that day. And when, at the last,
he looked round the court, and, after a moment
of silence, more eloquent than words, began with
a deep and low-voiced impressiveness; “I see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
around me here a crowd of men—fathers, husbands,
and brothers—men who have women they
love at home, and whose honor lies in the hands
of those women. Which of us, my brothers—my
fellow-men,” he cried suddenly, aloud, stretching
forth his right arm in a passionate appeal to those
before him, “which of us all, did those women
whom we love stand where my unfortunate client
stood upon that fatal night, alone in the darkness,
with no arm to defend her, no ear to hear
her cry, with nothing but a certain and a shameful
dishonor before her—which of us, I say, would
not desire that the women we love and hold
sacred, you and I, and every true man in all England,
should do as this woman did; and save her
honor at all costs?”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of applause that ran
round the court as he sat down. Then the
judge summed up strongly in her favor. There
had been no evidence to contradict the prisoner’s
own statement. No eye save her own had been
in that chamber of death in the darkness of the
night. Something, indeed, had been said about
signs of more force having been used than it was
in the power of a woman’s frail hands to employ,
but there had been no evidence in support of
that theory; not a vestige of any other presence
in the prisoner’s chamber, save that of her would-be
destroyer, had come to light; and the jury
must bear in mind that a desperate woman is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
often given an almost miraculous strength in such
moments of horror and of fear, and that if the
blow with the silver dagger had been, as it appeared,
struck first, the victim would necessarily
have become much weakened, and was probably
in a partial state of collapse.</p>

<p>There was much more of it, but it was all in
her favor, and almost before the jury retired it
was felt that their decision was a foregone conclusion.
No one could righteously condemn a
woman to death for murder who had taken a
man’s life under such circumstances as these.
So the horror of it all came to an end, and Lady
Francis Onslow was told that she was free; that
she could go where she pleased, and do as she
liked.</p>

<p>One thing there was, however, that not all the
judges and the juries in the land could do for
her; they could not wash the stain of blood from
her hands.</p>

<p>It was when Clitheroe Jacynth came that night
to visit her at her hotel in Dover Street (she had
left for London immediately after the trial), that
this terrible fact first came home to her in all its
dreadful reality. As he entered the room, she
ran gladly to meet him, impulsively reaching out
both her small hands to him.</p>

<p>“It is to you I owe my life!” she cried; “it is
you who have saved me. How can I ever repay
you, or ever thank you enough?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>But Jacynth stood with a grave, sad face, and
downcast eyes, and arms folded together across
his breast, and took no notice whatever of those
little white hands stretched out to him.</p>

<p>A dull sense of dismay crept over her; something—she
hardly knew why or wherefore—struck
a cold chill to her heart, and her hands sank nervelessly
down again to her side.</p>

<p>“Won’t you shake hands with me, Mr.
Jacynth?—you, who have just saved my life?”</p>

<p>“If I have saved you, it is because it was my
duty, and because—because—alas, I love you,
Fenella! and I shall love you to my dying day!
That is why, if I can serve you, I will do so, if I
can be of use to you. You can command me
now, and always, but I cannot take your hand,
for there is blood on it!” and he averted his face
gloomily.</p>

<p>There was a moment of terrible silence between
them. In the old days Fenella would have
flamed out at him—would have heaped abuse and
rage and anger upon his head; but now she said
not one single word—not one. The events of
the last month had broken her down, and crushed
her to the earth, and her tongue was tied. She
could not deny the charge, nor tell the truth.
She had taken this blood-guiltiness upon her soul
to save him she loved—and to the end she must
bear it—to the end! Only, she had not realized
before how dreadful it would be to bear. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Jacynth, who had worshiped the very ground
she stood upon, should refuse to touch her hand,
was very terrible to her.</p>

<p>She sat down. There was a moment of intense
silence, then dully, spiritlessly, she asked:</p>

<p>“Why have you come here, then?”</p>

<p>“To see you—to help and advise you, if you
will take my help, and to tell you about Ronny.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Ronny!” she cried, looking at him with
a sudden eagerness, while a pink flush flooded
her pale cheeks. “Where is Ronny? I must
have him. Will you bring him to me now—at
once—this very night?”</p>

<p>“My dear Lady Francis, I want you to be very
reasonable and sensible, and to listen to me.”</p>

<p>“I never was reasonable and sensible in my
life,” she began—with a little pout and a shrug of
her shoulders that reminded him almost too painfully
of her own wayward self—“but I will listen
if you like,” she added humbly.</p>

<p>“I want you to let Ronny be where he is—for
the present at least. He is with my sister Helen,
and with Grandison her boy, his old playfellow.
I think it would be good for them both to be left
together. My nephew has an excellent tutor,
and Ronny can share his lessons. My sister has
taken them both down to the country, to her
home in Sussex. She was very hard to you,
Fenella, but she is not really a bad-hearted
woman, and she was very, very sorry for poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
little Ronny when—when it all happened—and
when—you were taken from him. Let Ronny be
where he is.”</p>

<p>“But I want him, I want him!” she cried.
“He is all I have on earth—why should I be
parted from him?”</p>

<p>“For his own good, Fenella!”</p>

<p>“It is best for a child to be with his mother.”</p>

<p>He looked at her fixedly, but very sadly and
seriously.</p>

<p>“Do you think so,” he asked slowly—“in this
case?”</p>

<p>Then she understood. Understood, that because
of the brand of Cain upon her brow, the
world would not think it good for her boy to be
brought up by his own mother!</p>

<p>Her cup of woe was indeed full. She bowed
her head—the bright brown head that he would
have died to serve—upon her hands, and wept
aloud.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” he said, a little unsteadily; “don’t
give way; be brave, as you always have been, my
dear. Live down this story—this stain upon
your life; go to other countries, where no one
will know you; make new friends, who will have
heard nothing. The world is before you; leave
England, and do not come back to your boy till
time has covered up with its kindly mantle this
wretched episode of your life. Ronny shall be
well cared for. I will look after him, and write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
to you constantly about him. Only—for his own
sake—separate yourself entirely from him, until
he is old enough to know and to choose.”</p>

<p>He waited for a moment, looking at her yearningly
and anxiously, but the bowed head never
stirred. Then, in the silence and gloom of the
bare and half-lit room, he turned, and left her
alone in her sorrow and her desolation.</p>

<p>Thirty-six hours later Fenella stood by herself
upon the deck of a Channel steamer, watching
the white cliffs of England as they receded
further and further into the distance. She was
quite alone in the world—she had not even taken
a maid with her. She had made up her mind that
she would break every connection of her former
life, and start entirely anew. There should not
be even a servant about her to remind her of her
past. It was for this reason that she had decided
to go to the Channel Islands—for a time at least,
until she could settle her further plans. Guernsey
was a quiet and comparatively secluded place,
and she was not likely to meet any of her former
friends and acquaintances there, and it would be
easy to go on to France from there, should she
feel inclined to do so.</p>

<p>Jacynth entirely approved of her idea, and
went down himself with her to Weymouth to see
her off. To be with her in so close a friendship,
and yet to be unable even to take her hand as a
friend should do, was inexpressibly painful to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
yet he did not shrink from sacrificing his own
feelings in order to serve her, whom, in spite of
everything, he still loved and admired more than
any woman on earth.</p>

<p>“I have treated you very badly,” she said to
him once on the train; “I led you on and flirted
with you, and made you fall in love with me, and
all for nothing but the pleasure of making an
empty conquest! I played with your heart as I
have done with that of dozens of others; but I
think you will allow that I have been punished
for it!”</p>

<p>He could not answer her. The punishment
her own folly had brought upon her was indeed
terrible. And yet he did not know one-half of the
burden she had to bear; nor did he guess at her
hopeless and helpless love for the husband for
whose crime she was suffering, that seemed to
have sprung up into new life in her heart during
these last three weeks of peril and of well-nigh
despair.</p>

<p>Where was he for whom she had suffered so
much, for whose sin her own life had been in
jeopardy? This was the question she asked of
herself, wildly and despairingly, as she leant over
the bulwarks of the steamer, and watched the
green waves, as they hurried by and dashed
themselves into foam against the side of the
vessel.</p>

<p>Who that had known the wild, reckless girl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
old, the Lady Francis who had flirted, and
laughed, and danced; who had shocked her
acquaintances, and terrified her best friends, by
her mad and foolish frolics—who would have
recognized Lady Francis Onslow in the sad-eyed
“Mrs. Orme,” in her dark and Quakerlike simplicity
of dress, who stood mournfully alone upon
the steamer, and looked her last upon her native
shores.</p>

<p>It is a week later. A little furnished house,
standing in a garden that runs down to the edge
of the cliff, about a mile out of St. Peter’s Port,
has been taken by a quiet but very lovely little
lady, who apparently is a widow, and who has
given her name to the house agent as “Mrs.
Orme.”</p>

<p>She has engaged a couple of maids, and filled
her tiny house with the flowers for which Guernsey
is famous, and that are so cheap that not to
have flowers in every corner is not to have the
very breath of life. The window of her little sitting
room looks over the blue sea that is bluer
than any other sea in English waters. Out there
is the low land of Herm, and all the little rocky
islands glittering and shining like jewels set in
the blue, and far away the long straight line of
Sark, with her steep cliffs and jagged rocks filling
in the picture on the horizon; while, in the foreground,
there are countless little sails of snowy
whiteness that move to and fro upon the crisp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and azure waters. “Mrs. Orme” sits watching it
all from her garden lawn. It amuses her vaguely
and quietly, but she has nothing to do, and it
is very dull and quiet at Prospect Cottage. It
gives her quite a little excitement when a beautiful
schooner yacht turns into the bay, with all
her sails set, and makes as straight as wind and
tide can take her for the entrance of the harbor.</p>

<p>Fenella thought she would run down to the
quay to see her come in. She was glad of an excuse
to go into the town, so she started off quite
in good spirits, having attired herself quickly in a
smart little sailor hat and a trim serge jacket.</p>

<p>“I can call at the post-office, and see if there
are any letters from Jacynth or Ronny,” she
thought; and so she started off, little knowing
that she was starting to meet a new complication
in her fate.</p>

<p>The beautiful yacht came in, nearer and nearer
to port—her sails came down with a ringing noise,
and from the shore one could hear the cries and the
songs of the sailors upon the deck. Fenella stood
among the crowd upon the quay watching her.</p>

<p>“What yacht is that?” she asked of a respectable-looking
individual, in the blue serge garments
of a seafaring man, who stood next to her.</p>

<p>“She’s the <i>Seamew</i>, a hundred-and-twenty-ton
schooner,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“And to whom does she belong?”</p>

<p>“To Lord Castleton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>Fenella started. “To Lord Castleton!” she
repeated blankly.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay! but he aint aboard her now; he have
lent her, I hear, to a friend who has had her for
the last six weeks. She started from this very
port, did the <i>Seamew</i>, six weeks ago, bound for
Madeira and the Canary Islands, where she have
been cruising about ever since, and now she have
come home again to the very day, as she was expected
to do.”</p>

<p>“You are quite <i>sure</i> Lord Castleton is not on
her?” inquired Fenella, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Sartin sure, Miss”—they always called her
“Miss,” she was so young and girlish!—“his
lordship was off to the south of France the werry
day she started, and that’s how he came to lend
his schooner to his friend.”</p>

<p>Fenella breathed anew. “And the friend’s
name?” she inquired, after a minute; but her acquaintance
had already moved away from her
side, and was talking to some cronies of his own
further on.</p>

<p>The yacht had settled down to her moorings in
the dock. The crowd began to disperse—there
seemed nothing more to wait for, and Fenella,
with the rest, moved away.</p>

<p>She had an errand or two to do in the town before
going home, and so she clambered up the
steep, irregular, picturesque little street, and went
about her small shoppings. Just as she was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
to turn into a baker’s shop, half-way up the hill,
a man’s tall slender figure, in a blue serge suit and
peaked cloth cap, suddenly darkened the narrow
doorway.</p>

<p>“Frank!” she gasped, falling back a step.</p>

<p>“My God—<i>Fenella</i>!” he said; and for a moment
they stood there—pale, speechless, petrified,
gazing with horror and despair into each
other’s faces.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br>

BY BRAM STOKER.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Francis Onslow</span> lifted his cap. The
action was an instinctive one, for he was face to
face with a lady; but he was half dazed with the
unexpected meeting, and could not collect his
thoughts. He only remembered that when he
had last seen his wife she was opening the door
of her chamber to De Mürger. For weeks he had
been schooling himself for such a meeting, for he
knew that on his return such might at any time
occur; but now, when the moment had come, and
unexpectedly, the old pain of his shame overwhelmed
him anew. His face grew white—white
till it seemed to Fenella that it was of the pallor
of death. She knew that she had been so far
guilty of what had happened that the murder had
been the outcome of her previous acts. She knew
also that her husband was ignorant of his part in
the deed—and her horror of the man, blood-guilty
in such a way, was fined down by the sense of
her own partial guilt. The trial, with all its consequent
pain to a proud and sensitive woman, had
softened her, and she grasped at any hope. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
sight of Frank, his gaunt cheeks, which told their
tale of suffering, and now the deadly pallor, awoke
all the protective feeling which is a part of a
woman’s love. It was with her whole soul in her
voice that she said again:</p>

<p>“Frank!” His voice was stern as well as sad
as he answered her:</p>

<p>“What is it?” Her heart went cold, but she
persevered.</p>

<p>“Frank, I must have a word with you—I must.
For God’s sake, for Ronny’s sake, do not deny
me.” She did not know that as yet Frank
Onslow was in ignorance of De Mürger’s death;
and when his answer came it seemed more hard
than even he intended:</p>

<p>“Do you wish to speak of that night?” In a
faint voice she answered:</p>

<p>“I do.” Then looking in his eyes and seeing
the hard look becoming harder still—for a man is
seldom generous with a woman where his honor
is concerned, she added:</p>

<p>“O Heaven! Frank! You do not think me
guilty! No, no, not you! not you! That would
be too cruel!”</p>

<p>Frank Onslow paused and said:</p>

<p>“Fenella, God help me! but I do,” and he
turned away his head. His wife, of course,
thought that he alluded to the murder, and not
to her sin against him as he saw it, and with a
low moan she turned away and hid her face in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
hands. Then with an effort she drew herself up,
and without a word or a single movement to
show that she even recognized his presence, she
passed on up the street.</p>

<p>Frank Onslow stood for a few moments watching
her retreating figure, and then went across
the street and turned the next corner on his way
to the post-office, for which he had been inquiring
when he met his wife. At the door he was
stopped by a cheery voice and an outstretched
hand:</p>

<p>“Onslow!”</p>

<p>“Castleton!” The two men shook hands
warmly.</p>

<p>“I see you did not get my telegram,” said
Lord Castleton. “It is waiting for you at the
post-office.”</p>

<p>“What telegram?”</p>

<p>“To tell you that I was on my way here from
London. I went in your interest, old fellow. I
thought you would like full particulars—the
newspapers are so vague.”</p>

<p>“What papers? My interest? Tell me all. I
am ignorant of all that has passed for the last six
weeks.” A vague, shadowy fear began to creep
over his spirits. Castleton’s voice was full of
sympathy as he answered:</p>

<p>“Then you have not heard of—but stay. It is
a long story. Come back to the yacht. I was
just going to join you there. We shall be all alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and I can tell you all. I have the newspapers
here for you.” He motioned to a roll under his
arm.</p>

<p>The two went down to the harbor, and finding
the sailor waiting with the boat at the steps,
were rowed to the yacht and got on board.
Here the two men were all alone. Then, with a
preliminary clearing of his voice, Castleton began
his story:</p>

<p>“Frank Onslow—better get the worst over at
once—just after you went away from Harrogate
your wife was tried for murder and acquitted.”</p>

<p>“My God! Fenella tried for murder? Whose
murder?”</p>

<p>“That scoundrel De Mürger. It seems he
went into her room in the night and attempted
violence, so she stabbed him——”</p>

<p>Castleton stopped in amazement, for a look of
radiance came over Frank Onslow’s face, as he
murmured “Thank God!” Recalled to himself
by Castleton’s silence, for he was too amazed to
go on, Frank said: “I have a reason, old fellow;
I shall tell it to you later, but go on. Tell me
all the facts, or let me read the papers. Remember
I am as yet quite ignorant of it all and I am
full of anxiety!”</p>

<p>Without a word Castleton handed him the
papers, and, lighting a fresh cigar, sat down with
his back to him, and presently yielded to the sun
and fresh air and fell into a doze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Frank Onslow took the papers, and read carefully
from end to end the account of the trial of
his wife for the murder of De Mürger. When
he had finished he sat with the folded paper in
his hand, and his eyes had the same far-away
look in them which they had had on that fatal
night. The hypnotic trance was on him again.</p>

<p>Presently he rose, and with stealthy steps approached
his sleeping friend. Murmuring “Why
did I not kill him?” he struck with the folded
paper, as though with a dagger, the form before
him. Castleton, who had sunk into a pleasant
sleep and whose fat face was wreathed with a
smile, was annoyed at the rude awakening.
“What the devil!” he began angrily, and then
stopped as his eyes met the face of his
friend and he realized that he was in some sort of
trance. He grew very pale as he saw Frank
Onslow stab, and stab, and stab again. There
was a certain grotesqueness in the affair—the
man in such terrible earnest, in his mind committing
murder, while his real weapon was but a
folded paper. As he stabbed he hissed, “Why
did I not kill him? Why did I not kill him?”
Then he went through a series of movements as
though he were softly pulling an imaginary door
shut behind him, and so back to his own chair,
where he sat down hiding his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Castleton sat looking at him in amazement,
and then murmured to himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“They thought it was someone stronger than
Fenella whose grasp made those marks on the
dead man’s throat.” He suddenly looked round
to see that no one but himself had observed what
had happened, and then, being satisfied on this
point, murmured again:</p>

<p>“A noble woman, by Jove! A noble
woman!” He called out;</p>

<p>“Frank—Frank Onslow! Wake up, man.”
Onslow raised his head as a man does when suddenly
awakened, and smiled as he said:</p>

<p>“What is it, old man? Have I been asleep?”
It was quite evident that he had no recollection
of what had just passed. Castleton came and
sat down beside him, and his kindly face was
grave as he asked:</p>

<p>“You have read the papers?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“Now tell me—you offered to do so—why you
said ‘Thank God!’ when I told you that your
wife had killed De Mürger?”</p>

<p>Frank Onslow paused. Although the memory
of what he had thought to be his shame had
been with him daily and nightly until he had
become familiarized with it, it was another thing
to speak of it, even to such a friend as Castleton.
Even now, when it was apparent from the issue
of the trial that his wife had avenged so dreadfully
the attempt upon her honor, he felt it
hard to speak on the subject. Castleton saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
doubt and struggle in his mind which was reflected
in his face, and said earnestly, as he laid
his hand upon his shoulder:</p>

<p>“Do not hesitate to tell me, Frank. I do not
ask out of mere curiosity. I am perhaps a better
friend than you think in helping to clear up a
certain doubt which I see before me. I think
you know I am a friend.”</p>

<p>“One of the best a man ever had!” said
Frank impulsively, as he took the other’s hand.
Then turning away his head, he said slowly:</p>

<p>“You were surprised because I was glad
Fenella killed that scoundrel. I can tell you,
Castleton, but I would not tell anyone else. It
was because I saw him enter her room, and, God
forgive me! I thought at the time that it was
by her wish. That is why I came away from Harrogate
that night. That is what kept me away.
How could I go back and face my friends with
such a shame fresh upon me? It was your lending
me your yacht, old man, that made life possible.
When I was by myself through the wildness
of the Bay of Biscay and among the great
billows of the Atlantic I began to be able to bear.
I had steeled myself, I thought, and when I
heard that so far from my wife being guilty of
such a shame, she actually killed the man that
attempted her honor, is it any wonder that I felt
joyful?”</p>

<p>After a pause Castleton asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“How did you come to see—to see it. Why
did you take no step to prevent it? Forgive me,
old fellow, but I want to understand.”</p>

<p>Frank Onslow went to the rail, and leaned
over. When he came back Castleton saw that
his eyes were wet. With what cheerfulness he
could assume, he answered:</p>

<p>“On that very night I had made up my mind
to try to win back my wife’s love. I wrote a
letter to her, a letter in which I poured out my
whole soul, and I left my room to put it under
her door, so that she would get it in the morning.
But”—here he paused, and then said, slowly,
“but when in the corridor, I saw her door open,
and at the same moment De Mürger appeared.”</p>

<p>“Did she seem surprised?”</p>

<p>“Not at first. But a moment after a look of
amazement crossed her face, and she stepped
back into the room, he following her.” As he
said this he put his head between his hands and
groaned.</p>

<p>“And then?” added his friend.</p>

<p>“And then I hardly know what happened. My
mind seems full of a dim memory of a blank existence,
and then a series of wild whirling
thoughts, something like that last moment after
death in Wiertz’s picture. I think I must have
slept, for it was two o’clock when I saw Fenella,
and the clock was striking five when I crossed the
bridge after I had left the hotel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“And the letter? What became of it?”</p>

<p>Frank started. “The letter? I never thought
of it. Stay! I must have left it on the table in
my room. I remember seeing it there a little
while before I came away.”</p>

<p>“How was it addressed? Do not think me
inquisitive, but I cannot help thinking that that
letter may yet be of some great importance.”</p>

<p>Frank smiled, a sad smile enough, as he answered:
“By the pet name I had for Fenella—Mrs.
Right. I used to chaff her because she
always defended her position when we argued,
and so, when I wanted to tease her, I called her
Mrs. Right.”</p>

<p>“Was it written on hotel paper?”</p>

<p>“No. I was going to write on some, but I
thought it would be better to use the sort we had
when—when we were first married. There were
a few sheets in my writing case, so I took one.”</p>

<p>“That was headed somewhere in Surrey, was
it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Chiddingford, near Haslemere. It was
a pretty place, too, called ‘The Grange.’ Fenella
fell in love with it, and made me buy it
right away.”</p>

<p>“Is anyone living there now?”</p>

<p>“It is let to someone. I don’t think that I
heard the name. The agent knows. When the
trouble came I told him to do what he could with
it, and not to bother me with it any more. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
a while he wrote and asked if I would mind it
being let to a foreigner? I told him he might
let it to a devil so long as he did not worry
me.”</p>

<p>Lord Castleton paused awhile, and asked the
next question in a hesitating way. He felt embarrassed,
and showed it:</p>

<p>“Tell me one thing more, old fellow—if—if you
don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“My dear Castleton, I’ll tell you anything you
like.”</p>

<p>“How did you sign the letter?” Onslow’s
face looked sad as he answered:</p>

<p>“I signed it by another old pet name we both
understood. We had pet names—people always
have when they are first married,” he added with
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Of course,” murmured the sympathetic Castleton.</p>

<p>“One such name lasted a long time. An old
friend of my father’s came to see us, and in a
playful moment he said I was a ‘sad dog.’
Fenella took it up and used to call me ‘Doggie,’
and I often signed myself ‘Frank Doggie’—as
men usually do.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” again murmured Castleton, as if
such a signature was a customary thing. Then
he added, “And on this occasion?”</p>

<p>“On this occasion I used the name that seemed
full of happiest memories. ‘Frank Doggie’ may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
seem idiotic to an outsider, but to Fenella and
myself it might mean much.”</p>

<p>The two men sat silent awhile, and then Castleton
asked softly:</p>

<p>“I suppose it may be taken for granted that
Lady Francis never got the letter?”</p>

<p>“I take it, it is so; but it is no matter now, I
refused to speak with her just before I met you.
I did not know then what I know now—and she
will never speak to me again.” He sighed as he
spoke, and turned away. Then he went to the
rail of the yacht and leaned over with his head
down, looking into the still blue water beneath
him.</p>

<p>“Poor old Frank!” said Castleton to himself.
“I can’t but think that this matter may come
right yet. I must find out what became of that
letter, in case Lady Francis never got it. It
would prove to her that Frank——”</p>

<p>His train of thought suddenly stopped. A
new idea seemed to strike him so forcibly that it
quite upset him. Onslow, who had come over
from the rail, noticed it. “I say, Castleton, what
is wrong with you? You have got quite white
about the gills.”</p>

<p>“Nothing—nothing,” he answered hastily. “I
am subject to it. They call it heart. Pardon
me for a bit, I’ll go to my bunk and lie down,”
and he went below.</p>

<p>In truth, he was overwhelmed by the thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
which had just struck him. If his surmise were
true, that Onslow, in a hypnotic trance, as he had
almost proved by its recurrence, had killed De
Mürger, where, then, was Fenella’s heroism after
all? True that she had taken the blame on herself;
but might it not have been that she was morally
guilty all the same? Why, then, had she taken
the blame? Was it not because she feared that
her husband might have refused to screen her
shame; or because she feared that if any less
heroic aspect of the tragedy was presented to the
public, her own fair fame might suffer in greater
degree? Could it indeed be that Fenella Onslow
was not a heroine, but only a calculating woman
of exceeding smartness? Then, again, if Frank
Onslow believed that his wife had avenged her
honor, was it wise to disturb such belief? He
might think, if once the suggestion were made to
him, that his honor was preserved only by his
own unconscious act. Was it then wise to disturb
existing relations between the husband and
wife, sad though they were? Did they come together
again, they might in mutual confidence
arrive at a real knowledge of the facts, and then—and
then, what would be the result? And besides,
might there not be some danger in any
suggestion made as to his suspicion of who struck
the blow? It was true that Lady Francis had
been acquitted of the crime, although she confessed
to the killing; but her husband might still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
be tried—and if tried? What then would be the
result of the discovery of the missing letter on
which he had been building such hopes?</p>

<p>The problem was too much for Lord Castleton.
His life had been too sunny and easy-going to
allow of familiarity with great emotions, and such
a problem as this was to him overwhelming. The
issue was too big for him; and revolving in his
own mind all that belonged to it, he glided into
sleep.</p>

<p>He was wakened by the sound of oars and
voices drifting in through the open port.</p>

BY FLORENCE MARRYAT.<br>
<br>
<small>MME. DE VIGNY’S REVENGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">Revenge is sweet—especially to women.—<i>Byron.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> of all the visitors who were in the
Prospect Hotel on the night of De Mürger’s murder
the one to be most perplexed was Lucille de
Vigny. To her Lord Francis Onslow’s mysterious
disappearance was (at first) inexplicable.
Yesterday he had been her lover, full of protestations
of affection, and ready, as she believed, to
fly with her anywhere. To-day he had flown by
himself, and without leaving a word of explanation
behind him. But, as the whole of the circumstances
came to light, when Lady Francis was
dragged away from the hotel in custody, on the
charge of the count’s murder, Mme. de Vigny
thought she had solved the riddle. She had no
belief in Fenella’s account of the defense of her
honor. She sneered at the idea with an incredulous
smile. But she <i>did</i> think that Lord Francis
had found his wife and Count de Mürger together
and had killed his rival before her eyes, or perhaps
injured him so much with his muscular English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
fists that he had died from the effects. And
then the wife, preferring to stand her trial for manslaughter
sooner than confess her infidelity, had
taken the crime, or the accident, or whatever you
may like to call it, on her own shoulders, but for
no love of the absent husband, who would probably
refuse ever to see her again.</p>

<p>So far Mme. de Vigny’s intelligence, which had
not ripened in an entirely moral atmosphere, had
led her pretty near the truth. But her conclusion
was like a broken watch, useless because the mainspring
was missing. For she did not stop there.
She completed the story for herself. Lord
Francis had flown, not for his wife’s sake nor his
own—but in order not to drag <i>her</i> (whom he
loved) into the miserable tangle of his married
life. He would remain away until everything
was concluded, and then he would seek her out
again, and they would be happy. Such a terrible
scandle would surely be followed by a divorce,
after which he would be free to put her in the
place left vacant by his wife’s infidelity. But the
trial of Lady Francis Onslow took place, as has
been related, and yet no intelligence came of her
missing husband. When she had left Harrogate,
and the child had been taken away, Mme. de
Vigny became tired of being left behind.
She returned to London, and went down to
Haslemere, thinking Lord Francis might be lying
<i>perdu</i> in his country home. But all she found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
there was a large board stating that The Grange
was to be let, furnished, and that applications were
to be addressed to Mr. Abraham Hewett, of
Chancery Lane. Quick as thought she resolved
(if possible) to take it.</p>

<p>She had no love for the country, nor for a
secluded life, but to settle in his very home must
be, she argued, the best way by which to come
in contact with Lord Francis Onslow. Even if
he did not come there he must, sooner or later,
learn the name of his tenant, and be drawn into the
circle of her love again. She found no difficulty
in the matter. Her references were the best of
all—ready cash—and Mr. Hewett had been instructed
to let The Grange as soon as possible.
Her foreign accent somewhat puzzled him, and
he had mentioned her to his client (as Onslow told
Lord Castleton) simply as a foreigner.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had tried to increase his mystification
by speaking as incoherently and writing as
illegibly as she could. Anyway, she secured The
Grange, and took possession of it.</p>

<p>How much she reveled at first in the thought
that she was living in the house which Lord
Francis called his own, using the same furniture,
and walking in the same garden that he had been
used to walk in. Before long she hoped that he
would be there too, watching the moon rise above
the summits of the fine old trees. She searched
the house for some memento of him—a cast-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
glove, a faded flower. But the housemaid’s broom
had been too busy, and the Grange was inviolate
from attic to basement. Only in a little drawer
in his looking-glass stand she had found a few
of his visiting cards, evidently forgotten or overlooked.</p>

<p>“Lord Francis Onslow, The Grange, Chiddingford,”
and on the other side, “The Corinthians,
Pall Mall.” How sweet the words looked! The
enraptured woman raised them to her lips as she
thought that some day she might own a corresponding
passport to society. Meantime Mme. de
Vigny did not enjoy her solitude long. While
the man she dreamed of was hiding himself in Paris,
and on the <i>Seamew</i>, others of her acquaintance
tracked her to The Grange, and intruded their
presence upon her. Lucille de Vigny was too
beautiful, and, unfortunately, too notorious, to
conceal herself successfully. She had had many
admirers besides Lord Francis Onslow, and before
she had been many weeks at Chiddingford they
commenced to run down from London to call
upon her. And she was pleased to see them.
She had not been used to the company of her
own thoughts.</p>

<p>They proved ugly company to her on occasions—she
had not always the courage to look
back—and she earnestly hoped to make for herself
a future on which the past should have no
power to obtrude. So, pending the return of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Lord Francis, she was glad to welcome the various
friends who considered it worth their while
to travel down to see her. Among them was
Colonel Uriah B. Clutterbuck, a Senator from the
United States, who had made a large fortune
over railway iron, and was trying to spend it in
the old country. He had been an ardent admirer
of Mme. de Vigny from the first day of their
acquaintance, and would have proposed to her
long before, had not Lord Francis Onslow’s claims
stood in his way.</p>

<p>But now the colonel thought he saw his opportunity.
The first evening he dined with Lucille,
and she took him after dinner into the garden,
his heart overflowed, and he was able to contain
himself no longer.</p>

<p>“Mrs. der Vin-yay,” he commenced, “Loo-cill—if
I may call you so—there is no man in the
United States that can boast of a bigger pile than
your obedient servant. I am not a lord, ma’am;
I would disdain to be one. Neither am I, perhaps,
an Apoller; but, in point of dollars, Mrs.
der Vin-yay, you will not find my superior, and
they and I are at your service, to-day, and forever,
if you will only say the word.”</p>

<p>Mme. de Vigny looked at him with surprise,
mingled with a degree of contempt. She was a
magnificent woman, towering several inches above
the New York Senator, with a finely-molded
figure, large dark eyes, chiseled features, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
voluptuous mouth. She looked like a Juno regarding
a human rat.</p>

<p>“Colonel Clutterbuck,” she replied, “you astonish
me. Surely I have never encouraged you
to address me in such an extraordinary manner.
I have not the slightest intention of marrying
again, and I must beg you never to refer to the
subject.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mrs. der Vin-yay,” replied the discomfited
suitor, “say no more about it. I
thought you might have liked the pile, ma’am,
if you didn’t admire the man; but it won’t go
begging, Mrs. der Vin-yay, you may bet your
bottom dollar upon that.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to bet anything, Colonel Clutterbuck,”
said Lucille grandly, “nor should I
take money into consideration on a question of
marriage. But I am quite content with my life
as it is, and have no desire to alter it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You’re waiting for a title, Mrs. der Vin-yay,”
replied the Senator, “that’s where it is.
You’ll never tell me that a fine woman like yourself
means to remain single for the rest of her
life. But you’re gone on these English aristocrats,
like the gals in my country, and nothing
will satisfy you but to be a duchess or a
countess.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Clutterbuck, your remarks are positively
offensive, and I must entreat you to turn
your conversation to something else. I thank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
you for your offer, but I can never accept it.
Come indoors and let me give you a song. I had
a parcel of new ones down from London last
week.” She drew her lace wrap about her as she
spoke, and turned to re-enter the house. Her
handsome face looked proud and cold under the
moonlight, but her heart was throbbing warmly
against Lord Francis Onslow’s card, which she
carried in her bosom. She was not really faithful,
or affectionate, but she had set her mind upon
capturing and holding this man (as a woman sometimes
sets her mind upon a spaniel or a bonnet),
and would not rest until she had achieved her
purpose. In like manner the American Senator
had set his mind upon her, but he would not
break his heart over her refusal. He had thought
she would make a splendid picture at the head of
his New York table, and an enviable wife to present
to his friends, but if she couldn’t accept his
pile of dollars, he concluded that some other
lady would. So they parted on their usual terms,
and Lucille even asked him to repeat his visit on
the first opportunity. The next morning, when
her maid brought her letters into her room with
her coffee, she was struck by the appearance
among them of a pale buff letter, stamped on the
top “On H. M. Service,” and on the bottom,
“Dead Letter Office.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Rose?” she cried.</p>

<p>“I do not know, madame, but it was left here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
with the other letters, so I thought I had better
bring it up to you.”</p>

<p>Lucille had by this time seized the envelope
and read the superscription:</p>

<p>“Frank Doggie, Esq., The Grange, Chiddingford,
Haslemere.”</p>

<p>“How strange,” she laughed. “Who is Mr.
Frank Doggie, and why do they send his letters
here?”</p>

<p>“Shall I return it to the postman, madame?”</p>

<p>“No! It would be useless. I will keep it a
little while. It may be inquired for.” So the
maid retired, leaving the letter behind her. It
seemed to fascinate Lucille; though she had the
morning papers and several letters of her own to
peruse, her eyes kept turning toward the buff envelope
with marked curiosity, until she took it
up again and examined it carefully. What right
had Mr. Doggie to have the name of Frank?—that
name above all others so dear to her. The
fact alone seemed to make the letter her property.
It had come from the Dead Letter Office.
That showed that all reasonable inquiries had been
made for the owner without avail. There could
be no harm, then, in her reading it, for the more
she regarded it, the more curious she became to
learn its contents, so without further ado, she tore
it open. It contained an envelope addressed to
“Mrs. Right, Prospect Hotel, Harrogate,” and
scribbled all over, both in red and black ink, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
in various signatures, with the words, “Not
known here,” “Gone away,” “No such person,”
etc. This was the letter (as may be remembered)
that Lord Francis wrote with such a beating
heart to his wife on the night of De Mürger’s
murder, and left, in his subsequent horror and confusion,
on the table in his bedroom. When he
had gone, the servants carried it to the landlord,
who, knowing no one of the name of “Right,” had
delivered it over to the Post-office. And so it
had gone the round of Harrogate, being repudiated
everywhere, and finally found its way to
London, and was opened and returned to the address
engraved on the note-paper. “Mrs. Right
and Mr. Doggie.” Mme. de Vigny laughed at
the strange conjunction of names, as she prepared
to find out what Doggie and Right had to say to
each other. But she did not laugh long. The
first words her eyes lit upon made the color fade
from her cheek, while her hand clenched savagely
over the unoffending paper. They were the
words Frank had poured forth in the anguish of
his soul at Fenella’s feet:</p>

<p>“My darling—my own, <i>own</i> darling (for that
you must ever be to me, let who will come between
us), why will you make us both so unhappy?
I know you are not happy, Fenella! I
can read it in your face; hear it in each tone of
your voice. Those were not the looks and tones
that made the first years of our married life one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
long dream of bliss. And I am supremely miserable,
more so than yourself, for I have sinned
more against you than you have against me. I
confess it, dear love. I prostrate myself before
you, and I cry for forgiveness. Can you not forgive
me? Will you not take me to your heart
again, and let me try to atone for all the past?
My life is so barren without you and my darling
child. Do you suppose that anything can compensate
me for your loss? As for Mme. de
V., she is <i>nothing</i> to me—less than nothing; a
toy to pass away the time that goes so slowly
without you; an opiate that for a moment makes
me forget my pain, and sometimes, even while
I seem to yield to her witcheries, I loathe her
because she has come between us. But it shall
never be again, dear love, if you but say the word.
Come back to me, Fenella, and I will swear to
wipe her (and all like her) out of my life, as surely
as I would kill the viper that lay across your
path. Oh, when I think of all that she has cost
me, how bitterly I hate her!”</p>

<p>There was much more in the same strain, but
this was sufficient for Lucille, who lay back on
her pillow with the paper crushed in her hand,
and jealousy and revenge gleaming from her eyes.
<i>This</i> was how he thought of her, then. This was
how he wrote and spoke of her to his wife—his
faithless, flirting wife—the murderess, by her own
account, of Count de Mürger, the unworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
mother of his child—the creature to whom he
might, after all, return—so contemptible and despicable
and mean-spirited were men. How
could she be revenged on them both? On <i>him</i>
for so deceiving herself; and on <i>her</i> for retaining
her power over him?</p>

<p>Mme. de Vigny did not weep. Her temperament
was not of the weeping order, but she
gnashed her teeth with impotent fury as she lay
with her face buried in her pillow, and thought
out her best means of revenge. Her maid was
surprised to find how long a time elapsed before
her usual services were required, but after the
lapse of two hours she was summoned to her
mistress’s side.</p>

<p>Lucille was up, and engaged in writing.</p>

<p>“Tell George to take this telegram into Chiddingford
at once,” she exclaimed, handing it to
her.</p>

<p>It was addressed to Colonel Clutterbuck, and
ran as follows: “If not engaged, dine with me
this evening.”</p>

<p>When Mme. de Vigny had arrived at this decision,
she tried to calm herself, but it was a difficult
task. All day she raved against Providence
and the treachery of the man she had trusted in,
but, when the evening came, she arrayed herself in
her most becoming costume to meet the Senator.
She had made up her mind by that time. She
had refused him simply on account of her fatal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
passion for Lord Francis Onslow, but that was
over now—quenched as effectually as though it
had never been—and she was determined not to
let the colonel’s dollars slip through her fingers a
second time. For many reasons, too, America
would suit her better than England. How could
she have been such a fool as to think of giving it
up for a foolish love dream?</p>

<p>She looked more than handsome—she looked
bewitchingly seductive as she advanced with a
soft, luminous gaze to meet Clutterbuck, and
asked his pardon for the trouble she had given
him.</p>

<p>“But something has occurred since last night,
my dear friend,” she said, “that makes it necessary
for me to take a short sea voyage. My doctor
is rather alarmed about my health, and insists
on my obedience. So, as I have always had a
supreme longing to visit your delightful country,
I have decided to go to America for the autumn,
and want you to tell me the best means of getting
there. You must know so much,” she concluded,
as she slipped her arm confidingly through
his.</p>

<p>“Ah! Mrs. der Vin-yay!” exclaimed the colonel,
patting her little hand, “why can’t you
make up your mind to let me take you there?
You should travel like a queen, Loo-cill, and
there’s a house waiting for you in New York City
that might satisfy an empress. Say the word,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Mrs. der Vin-yay, say the word, and you’ll make
me the happiest man in the United States.”</p>

<p>“But there is an obstacle to our marriage,” she
whispered, “perhaps an insuperable one. Had it
not been so, I should have said ‘yes,’ last night.”</p>

<p>“Dollars can overcome all obstacles,” replied
the colonel. “What is it? I guess it’ll make no
difference between us.”</p>

<p>“I have a little nephew, the orphan child of an
only sister, now deceased, and I will marry no man
who asks me to leave him behind.”</p>

<p>“That man won’t be myself, Mrs. der Vin-yay.
Bring him along, by all means. There’s room in
the States for another boy or two, and I’ll do by
him as if he were my own.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you are too good, <i>too</i> good,” exclaimed
Lucille fervently, as she pressed his hand.</p>

<p>The Senator was not young, and in no mind to
wait, besides which he was anxious to get back to
his own country, so, as the lady’s wishes appeared
to coincide with his own, they arranged matters to
their mutual satisfaction that evening, and in a
fortnight were married at a registrar’s office in
London, without anyone but themselves being the
wiser for the transaction. Lucille had pleaded for
secrecy, lest her friends should interfere to prevent
her leaving England, and the colonel had
arrived at that age when a man detests all publicity
and fuss. So Mme. de Vigny was transformed
into Mrs. Colonel Clutterbuck as if by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
magic, and went home to the Langham Hotel
with her husband, as if they had been married
for twenty years. Four days after a well-known
steamer was to start from Liverpool for New York,
and their cabins were already secured on board of
her.</p>

<p>“And now!” said Lucille, with a winning smile,
the day before they started, “you must let me
run down into Suffolk, colonel, and fetch my
little nephew.”</p>

<p>“Suffolk? That’s a long way,” said Colonel
Clutterbuck. “Hadn’t I better go for you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no! I couldn’t hear of it. The
little fellow would be frightened out of his senses
at the sight of a stranger. He is terribly sensitive.
I can never coax him away, but by pretending
we are going to meet his poor, dear mother.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Mrs. Clutterbuck, have it your
own way,” replied the colonel, who was beaming
with pride in the possession of so handsome a
wife.</p>

<p>So Lucille, armed with Lord Francis Onslow’s
card, traveled down on the following day to
Felixstowe, where Jacynth’s sister, Mrs. Grandison,
was staying with her own son and little Ronny.</p>

<p>This was the Frenchwoman’s revenge. She
had heard while at Harrogate of Ronny’s destination,
and knew that in so small a place she
would experience little difficulty in finding out
which house was occupied by Mrs. Grandison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>She disliked children (as most women of her
stamp do), but she felt she could wreak no
bitterer vengeance on Lord Francis Onslow and
his wife than by depriving them of their son and
heir, so dearly loved by both of them.</p>

<p>Her marriage had been conducted so secretly
that she was most unlikely to be recognized as
Mrs. Clutterbuck, and once she had got the boy
to America she believed that (virtually) he would
be lost. What was to follow after that, or
whether the game would be worth the candle to
her, she never stayed to consider.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grandison, while engaged over her mid-day
meal with the children, was much surprised
to hear that a lady wished to speak to her. Still
more so when, on entering the drawing room, she
saw the fashionably attired Mrs. Clutterbuck.</p>

<p>“You are doubtless surprised to receive a call
from a perfect stranger, madam,” commenced
Lucille, with her charming accent; “but time
did not permit me to prepare you for my appearance.
I come as a messenger from Lord Francis
Onslow. I am an intimate friend of his, and of
his poor dear wife!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Mrs. Grandison gravely.</p>

<p>Her first opinion of Fenella’s conduct had been
intensified to horror when the news of the
murder and the trial were made public, and she
had only taken charge of Ronny under protest—at
the urgent request of her brother—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
because she had felt it to be a Christian duty to
keep the poor child, as far as possible, from hearing
the terrible things that were said of his
mother. But her dislike of the subject was so
great that when Lucille said she was an intimate
friend of the Onslows, she shrunk from her with
ill-concealed aversion.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” she reiterated slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and have been so for years. This has
been a terribly sad affair for them both, but let
us hope the worst is over. Lord Francis feels
naturally that it is best they should spend the
next few years, at least, out of England; therefore,
they start for the Brazils to-morrow, and
wish naturally to take Ronny with them.”</p>

<p>“Lord Francis is, then, reconciled to his
wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Why should he not be? The unfortunate
affair of Count de Mürger’s death really,
redounds to her credit, and what preceded it was
only a foolish misunderstanding!”</p>

<p>“Of course if Lord Francis is satisfied, no one
has a right to demur at his decision. You come
from him, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He asked me to fetch Ronny home for
him. He would have come himself, but he had
no time. Here is his card, which he begged me
to present to you, with a thousand thanks for
your kindness to his child.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grandison hardly knew what to do. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
disliked delivering Ronny into the charge of a
stranger, and yet she felt she had no right to keep
the boy against his parents’ wishes. She kept
turning the card over and over in her hands as
she considered the matter.</p>

<p>“Did you say they sailed to-morrow?” she
asked, presently.</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow, at four in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“It is a very sudden resolution.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. They have contemplated it for
weeks past, but Lady Francis’ health has prevented
them carrying it out. Now they have a
sudden opportunity of which they wish to avail
themselves. How long will it take to get Ronny
ready to go back with me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that can be done in half an hour. But I
wish my brother, who put him in my charge, had
written me word that his parents wished to resume
their guardianship.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of that,” snapped Lucille.
“All Lord Francis told me was to come down to
Felixstowe, and take back his boy to him at all
costs; and I should think a parent’s wish was
imperative.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Mrs. Grandison, “and I
should not dream of disputing it. If you will
kindly wait here for a few minutes I will bring
Ronny to you.”</p>

<p>She left the room as she spoke, and Lucille felt
that she had triumphed and her revenge would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
complete. She remembered how Fenella had
gloated over this boy, how Lord Francis had
written of him as his “darling child,” and smiled
to herself as she thought what they would both
say and do, when they found he had gone beyond
recall. In a short time the door opened again,
and Mrs. Grandison appeared with Ronny. He
recognized Lucille at once as the lady he had
seen at the <i>table d’hôte</i> at Harrogate.</p>

<p>“I know you!” he said, coming forward with
a shy, outstretched hand, “you were with my
papa at Harrogate.”</p>

<p>“And with your mamma, Ronny, of course.
We were all there together. But mamma wants
you sadly. She has been fretting terribly for her
boy. We are going back to her together.”</p>

<p>“Going back to mummy? Oh, I <i>am</i> glad! I
have wanted her so,” said Ronny, trying hard to
keep back his tears. “It’s been very jolly with
Harold, of course, and Mrs. Grandison’s been
ever so good to me—but I’ve missed mummy
every day. Shall we go at once? I’m all ready,
and my box is packed. And shall I see her to-day?
Oh! do let us make haste and go.”</p>

<p>He thrust his hand in that of Lucille as he
spoke, who rose smiling, and addressed Helen
Grandison:</p>

<p>“You see, madame, the ties of nature surmount
those of friendship. Please to accept the best
thanks of the parents of this boy, for your care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
of him at a very trying moment, to which I must
add my own, and wish you farewell.”</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon,” said Mrs. Grandison stiffly,
as she watched them get into the fly which was
in waiting, and drive away to the station.</p>

<p>And before she had time to acquaint Jacynth
with the circumstance, Ronny (still with the expectation
of meeting his mother) was far away on
the broad Atlantic!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br>

BY FRANK DANBY.</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Row</span> faster, man, row faster. Move—no, sit
where you are, but give me the other oars.
Pull, pull,” he said, “as if you were getting away
from hell.” And feverishly, with white set lips,
with gleaming eyes, Lord Francis accentuated
his words by his actions, and propelled the boat
with all the strength of which he was capable,
across the blue waters that kept him from Fenella.
His feet pressed against the wood, the muscles of
his arms standing out like iron, the youth in him
dying under the strain, his very brain ceasing to
act, and his heart almost standing still; he tried
by physical exertion to deaden that burning
mental pain that seized him as he felt, saw, heard,
and writhed under the sense that he had wronged
her, wronged Fenella, wronged the woman who
always was and always would be the one woman
on earth for him; wronged the girl love that had
lain on his breast, believed and loved him; the
child who had grown to womanhood in his
arms—Fenella, his wife.</p>

<p>And at last the keel of the boat grated on the
shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>He had sat still while Lord Castleton had
spoken of the trial. Once the stunning news
had overwhelmed him, he had become an automaton
and not a man. Sea and sky melted mistily
into each other, and mechanically from his
mouth issued the empty sentences. But then the
hours passed on, Castleton slept, the yacht lay at
its moorings, and then—then a glimmer of reason
and sense penetrated the dull concussion of that
first shock.</p>

<p>“Fenella,” he said, “Fenella;” it was a moan,
a cry; not a human being asking for his wife, but
a soul in anguish crying to its God.</p>

<p>“Did you call, sir?” asked the mate, coming
forward, touching his gold-braided cap; “did you
call?” With bloodshot eyes Frank looked at
him, saw beyond him: “Fenella.”</p>

<p>“Any part of Guernsey, sir?”</p>

<p>“I must get back, I must get back.”</p>

<p>All that he was capable of was a wish to get
back, to see her face again, to fling himself down
on his knees before her, see that fair sweet face,
that child’s face. Murderess they had called her,
unfaithful he had called her, O Heaven! and she
was his wife, and he——</p>

<p>And then he was in Guernsey again.</p>

<p>She sat at her window, still, white, silent. The
hours had crushed heavily over her, and spared
her nothing. Not until now did she know, not
until now did she realize all that her husband had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
been to her, all that she had looked for from him,
all the hope that had illumined the dark days of
her imprisonment, lit up her bare cell, flushed its
soft light over the court-house that dreadful day,
the day that until now had been the most dreadful
day of all her life.</p>

<p>A hundred eyes had been upon her, had burnt
greedily into her soul—curious eyes, searching
eyes, eyes all around. All the air was alive with
voices—voices that rose and fell monotonous,
persistent, dreadful. What were they saying?
Now a sentence disentangled itself, now another.
“The prisoner pleads guilty, my lord.” “The
prisoner!” How curious it sounded. “The
prisoner!” How should she know anything of
prisoners, dreadful creatures, shameful, lowering,
hideous? She had dreamed of them in her happy
childhood, and awaking, shuddering, had hidden
her face in nurse’s breast, or been soothed to rest
again in father’s arms.</p>

<p>“The prisoner is separated from her husband,”
went on that monotonous voice. How strange,
<i>she</i> was separated from her husband; strange she
should be like the <i>prisoner</i>, a shameful, disgraced
prisoner. And dreaming she smiled, smiled in the
dock, with a hundred opera glasses scanning her
fair pale face, and a hundred naked eyes burning
into her secrets.</p>

<p>But the smile woke her, she had always smiled;
but now, now it was a long time since she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
smiled. What was she smiling at? Then she
woke to the knowledge of her surroundings, and
she shuddered in the dock; the sweet face grew
white and convulsed; suddenly she burst out crying.
Crying aloud, poor child, poor wayward
child, who had meant to play through life, and
woke from her playing—here.</p>

<p>All alive and awake she was for the rest of that
horrible day, quivering and trembling and sobbing,
half child, half woman, as the trial wore on.
Ever and again the crimson flushed into her
cheek, her eyes suffused, her head bent, in a very
agony of shame; she heard horrible questions,
horrible answers. She felt herself undraped before
these inquisitorial eyes, and shrinking, drawing
her cloak round her with shaking hands, she
would try and hide her poor hot face.</p>

<p>But as the day wore on, something of hope
crept in warm about her heart. If Frank were
here, he would not let them talk so—Frank, her
lover. She heard again the passionate protestations
of their short betrothal. She felt again his
lips against hers. She was back again in the
golden days when the sun flush of love was over
all her life, and sun queen in those hours she had
played with her happiness. And pitifully the
tremulous lips murmured, “If Frank were here,
he would not let them hurt me; if Frank were
here!”</p>

<p>What a strange, complicated Fenella! Arraigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
for murder, she pleaded “Guilty.”
“Guilty,” though her hands were clean! With
the unthinking generosity of a child she did a
woman’s deed with a man’s heart. She took her
husband’s guiltless guilt upon herself, and cried,
“It was I,” while yet the horror of his act was
vibrating through her frame. She had not
counted the cost, could not. But if all the sum
of those dreadful hours and days had been spread
out before her, with shining eyes she would have
scanned it, and still have called out generously,
“It was I.”</p>

<p>But her heart was larger than her brain. Her
brain failed her a little at the last. She was dim,
confused, frightened. She forgot so much.
These men who were there to judge her, noting
the crouching, weeping girl, with golden hair
disheveled, bloodshot eyes, weak and shrinking,
<i>thinking</i> her guilty, <i>pronounced</i> her innocent, and
sent her forth free.</p>

<p>Free! but what a freedom! Where was Frank?
Where was anybody? Who was there to take
her in his strong arms, let her hide her face upon
his breast, weep there until her shame had died
away, and the memory of her degradation was
washed clean. Who, indeed?</p>

<p>The man who had defended her, who had been
her lover, who had been her friend, came to her
and he—he would not take her hand. He had
spoken to her of her boy, and the cold emptiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
of her heart ached with the sudden rush of her
emotion as she cried out, with outstretched arms:
“My boy! bring me my boy!” To press the
child in her arms, to feel the soft down of his
cheek against hers, to hear the lisping, “Muzzer,
muzzer, dear,” from his lips, to have his arms
about her—this, this would save her reason. She
felt her reason going, felt her mind darkened, the
path before her no longer clear. She was in a
gloomy world, groping helplessly for a warm,
human clasp of fellowship. Jacynth, her friend,
answered her mother-cry. Answered, and left
her childless.</p>

<p>Then he brought her here, here to this beautiful,
lonely, wind-girt, sea-girt island, and left her
to strain her eyes out into the sea, that said
nothing to her. The sky was empty for her, the
flowers, it seemed to her, faded as she looked.
Poor beauty! poor coquettish, light-hearted
Fenella!</p>

<p>Then she met Frank in the street, and light
flashed back to her, and memory and understanding.
In a rush of emotion she saw him as a lover,
as husband, as Murderer. She knew what he had
done. She knew, too, what she had done to save
him. “Frank!” the words rushed to her lips,
words of love, of forgiveness, of——and he repelled
her. Ice-cold on her heart he lay, his dead
love, his living contempt, and she who would
have died for him, seemed as if she died by him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
He killed her. Not physically; she still lived,
moved, breathed, but her faith was dead, and her
hope, and her youth. She staggered home to her
old seat by the window. She felt sick, and giddy,
and dazed as from an earthquake; all her world
was in ruins. It was only now she realized the
hope on which she had lived all this time. Only
now she knew that Frank had been the bulwark
on which she rested, the light toward which she
had looked. That though she was past reason,
and had not asked why he had delayed, she had
felt he would come, and that in his eyes she
would read his love for her that had never
swerved, his faith in her that would answer for
all things, his gratitude to her, gratitude that she
would put away, and not let him linger over, but
would banish and forget, and it should be forgotten.
Nothing should be between them any
more, but love. He would bring her back Ronny,
he and she and Ronny would be together always.</p>

<p>And then they had met and he had repulsed
her, rejected her, looked upon her coldly! She
was hopeless. She looked out over the blue sea,
the rocks, the sails, the harbor, but there was a
film before her eyes, all things were darkened.
Even the face of nature would never smile upon
her again. Hope was dead.</p>

<p>Then he came back. He knelt at her feet, he
called her by a thousand endearing names, he
kissed her hands, the hem of her dress. She sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
there dumb, stricken as a statue, the film darkening
before her eyes, and her brain throb, throbbing,
like the screw of a steam engine.</p>

<p>“Fenella, my wife, my darling! For Heaven’s
sake, listen to me. Don’t look at me like that,
my darling, hear me. I never knew. I swear, I
never knew. I was ill, I heard nothing, knew
nothing until an hour ago. My sweet, what you
must have suffered! Fenella, speak—a word, a little
word. Sweetheart, think of our childhood.”</p>

<p>And then a little moan came from her, a little
sighing moan, and she fell half forward. He
caught her in his arms. “Darling,” he said again
passionately, “only hear me. Ah!”</p>

<p>It was too late! Was it too late? She lay in
his arms white and cold and silent. Frank, kissing
those pale, cold lips, chafing those dead
hands, murmuring over her a thousand caressing
names, distracted with despair, desperately put
away the fear, and called for help in anguished
tones.</p>

<p>Then the women came in and were busy about
her, and there were moaning and lamentation, but
still she heard not.</p>

<p>Fenella was not dead, but she was ill—terribly
ill. The silver cord was not broken, but it was
strained to its last fiber. Weeks went by, weeks
when she lay in the little cottage at Guernsey,
and Frank crept about with anguished eyes, and
lived on the bulletins from the sick room. Weeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
during which, with the gold locks short cropped,
and the sweet face fever-flushed and unrecognizable,
Fenella lay in bed, and shrieked in her delirium
that Frank did not do it, that she did;
that Frank hated her because she had done it,
but she had not done it. There was blood on
her hands, horrible blood, human blood. There
was blood on his hands, but she would kiss
them. She was swimming in blood, drowning
in blood, but Frank would save her. Ronny
was on the shore, waiting for her, bright-faced
Ronny, waiting to kiss away the stains from
them both. And then she would call out again
that she was drowning, and call for Frank, always
for Frank, in agonized, delirious shrieks.</p>

<p>“Doctor! doctor!” He held him with hands
grown thin and wasted, spoke to him in a voice
all broken with tears, looked at him with eyes
dim with wild, convulsive crying: “Will she
live? will she live?”</p>

<p>The doctor was a man who had studied humanity
as well as physic.</p>

<p>“I think so,” he answered; “there is room for
hope. Every day gained brings us nearer to it.
If once she sleeps, sleeps naturally, I think—she
is saved.” He hesitated, and Frank, hanging on
his words, pressed him further.</p>

<p>“She will wake to reason—to mental restfulness?”</p>

<p>He was a man; he had heard his patient in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
her delirium. She had a history, this beautiful
young woman who called herself Mrs. Orme, and
over whom Lord Francis Onslow watched with
such care. She had a history, but he did not
know it—did not seek to know it. No idle
curiosity prompted his question. But if she
woke, and woke to trouble, then—then he could
not answer for the consequences.</p>

<p>“Will you let me tell you?” Before Dr. Fairfax
could say “Yes,” or “No,” Frank had
dragged him back into the room, and was pouring
out incoherently, quickly, the whole miserable
story; their courtship, their married life, their
bickerings, and the interference of relatives, their
separation, his jealousy, the <i>murder</i> that even
now he could not account for or remember—everything,
everything.</p>

<p>The doctor listened, grave, sympathetic.
Frank paused breathlessly.</p>

<p>“She has a child, you say—a little child? Did
she care for that, did she love it?”</p>

<p>“She worships him as (fool that I have been
not to have seen it) only a good woman could
love her child.” Frank’s jealousy was dead
forever.</p>

<p>“Then bring her child here. Let her wake
amid her natural surroundings—her husband by
her side, her child’s voice ringing in her ears, the
life of the ‘home’ about her. Let the past be
forgotten by her. Let peace be her healing, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
love her medicine. You will be her doctor, not
I, when there is recognition in her eyes, and she
is struggling back to a world that has been so
cruel to her.”</p>

<p>He took up his hat. He had spoken. They
must wait the hour.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br>

BY MRS. EDWARD KENNARD.<br>
<br>
<small>“THE SCARS REMAINED.”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Francis Onslow listened to Dr.
Fairfax’s advice, he resolved to act upon it without
loss of time, especially as he sadly realized
that in the present condition of affairs he could
do nothing to expedite his wife’s recovery. The
issue lay in God’s hands. He felt this keenly,
chafing at his helplessness. During the many
hours spent in the chamber of the sick woman,
he reviewed his past life with bitter repentance.
Little by little he distinctly perceived how unworthy
had been his own conduct, and how much
he was to blame for the terrible occurrences which
had recently taken place. When he recalled
Fenella as she was when they were first married,
he found it impossible to hold himself guiltless.
However wayward and childish she might have
been, in those days no one could doubt her purity
and innocence. Moreover, she loved him, and a
man does not lose a woman’s love without some
cause. Now she lay stained and crushed upon a
bed of pain, like a white lily stricken to earth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Her name was in all men’s mouths. The spotlessness
of her reputation had departed, never to
return. She might have been a happy wife and
mother, and now what was she? A creature
shunned by her kind, fallen from her pedestal,
and blackened by crime. Ah! it was pitiful to
think of; still more pitiful to trace the folly,
vanity, and wrong-doing which had brought about
such a result. Why could they not have rested
content with one another’s love. What a fevered,
unnatural existence theirs had been of late years.
He smiled a wan smile, as it occurred to him that
their histories contained an unwonted amount
of sensation and melodrama. Their experiences
would form a strange narrative. Once, long ago,
Fenella had loved him truly and well. Of that
he felt morally certain. If he had only exercised
a little patience with his beautiful child wife, and
sought to correct her errors by example, rather
than by preaching and criticism, how differently
things might have turned out. She was young.
Her faults were chiefly those of youth and ignorance,
combined with the natural craving for admiration
of a pretty woman. But there was no
harm in her—then. She might have been guided.
A girl in her teens is made of plastic material.
Her character is not firmly set as a rule, either
for good or evil. It was in his power to have influenced
her, and to have developed the finer side
of her nature. But, instead of this, what had he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
done? In lieu of recognizing the responsibility
which he assumed, by taking the life of another
into his keeping, he had sought to justify his own
shortcomings by exaggerating hers, and imitating
them. If she flirted, he flirted. If she were
foolish, he was doubly so. Was that the way for
the head of a family to behave? When her
coquetries irritated him, he looked for consolation
elsewhere, and eventually allowed himself to
fall completely under the spell of a middle-aged
woman, remarkable rather for her beauty than
her virtue. And then, when Fenella resented his
conduct, and in forcible language pointed out
that the marriage ceremony should be as binding
for the husband as the wife, what reply did he
make? He answered, in the false, unjust voice
of the world: “No; you labor under a very great
mistake in upbraiding me, and have no ground
whatever to stand upon. Society has decreed
that a man may do as he likes, be as unfaithful
(within certain limits) as he pleases; but you are
totally different. A woman cannot go out of
bounds, without getting the worst of it. Therefore,
once for all, you had better recognize your
position.”</p>

<p>He could see the hot blood rush to her cheek.
“But this is monstrous, no matter what Society
has decreed. May I ask, Frank, if such is the
law by which you intend to shape your conduct
in the future?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>With shame, he remembered his answer.
“Yes, Fenella. Right or wrong, it is the law of
every man of the world.”</p>

<p>And from that day they had become more and
more estranged, until at last their unhappiness
reached a culminating pitch, and by mutual desire,
they determined to separate. But had they
been happier apart than together? He, for one,
could answer that question in the negative. In
the midst of the wildest dissipation, the gayest
scene, his heart had ached, and ever in his
memory there dwelt the recollection of loving
words and looks, which no effort on his part could
banish. Looking back on the past, he saw that
he was even more to blame than she. There had
been faults on both sides, but mainly on his. As
he sank on his knees by Fenella’s bedside, he admitted
the fact, freely and without reserve. And
thus kneeling, a flood of tenderness and remorse
swept over his spirit, and he, who had not
prayed for years, and was in the habit of denying
the existence of a Deity, bowed down his
head, humbly, meekly, like a little child, and
prayed.</p>

<p>“Oh! good God,” he cried, “be merciful.
Spare her to me, if only that I may atone for all
my past errors by a life of devotion. We have
stood on the brink of a precipice. Almost she
and I have fallen into a bottomless pit; for in
our blindness we turned our backs upon thee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
but now, oh, great All-Father, strengthen us and
counsel us in this, our sore necessity.”</p>

<p>He arose from his knees, sobered but calm.
Then he stooped, kissed Fenella’s burning brow,
and went forth to seek his son—the little, innocent
boy, with the curly head and clear eyes,
the very thought of whom made his heart grow
big.</p>

<p>There are seasons in the lives of all of us when
the best of which we are capable rises to the surface—when
the resolutions which we make for
the future are not based on an insecure and
worthless foundation, but on a fixed and permanent
one. Such a time had come to Lord
Francis. He left Guernsey a chastened, but a
better man, determined henceforth to lead a new
and purer life.</p>

<p>The journey seemed interminable. The
tedious hours dragged on, and steam and
machinery were unable to convey him fast
enough to his destination. At last he reached
Felixstowe, and hurried to Mrs. Grandison’s residence.
Philip Grandison was related to the Onslow
family. Lord Francis had seen a great deal
of his wife before his marriage, and they called
each other by their Christian names.</p>

<p>“Helen,” he cried, as Mrs. Grandison, taken
aback by his unexpected visit and haggard appearance,
stared at him as at an apparition,
“where is Ronny? I want to see Ronny.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Bring him to me at once. Fenella murmured in
her delirium that he was with you.”</p>

<p>“Have you not sailed? You and Lady
Francis have not started, then, for Brazil, after
all?” she asked in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered impatiently. “I haven’t
the least idea what you are talking about.
There never was any question of our going to
Brazil. Fenella is lying at death’s door, and I
have come here to fetch Ronny away.”</p>

<p>“But, Frank, Ronny has gone. You yourself
sent for him. Surely you must remember having
done so.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> sent to fetch <i>Ronny</i>! Helen, have you
taken leave of your senses?” And he gripped
her hard by the wrist.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Frank,” shaking him off, and fearing
for his reason as she looked into his wild eyes;
“you hurt me.”</p>

<p>“I sent no one to take Ronny away,” he said,
with increasing excitement. “Do you mean to
say that the child is not here?”</p>

<p>“No, Ronny left us several days ago. I made
sure that you knew.”</p>

<p>Lord Francis staggered. The intelligence fairly
prostrated him. For a moment or two he could
not speak; then, in a hoarse voice, he said:</p>

<p>“Of course you know where the boy has gone,
Helen? You can tell me where to find him?
It is of the utmost importance that I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
take him back to Guernsey with me at once.
His mother’s life may depend upon Ronny’s
presence.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Grandison’s countenance assumed an expression
of sore perplexity. She felt that Lord
Francis held her responsible for his son.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” she said, “I have not the
least idea where he has gone. The other day a
lady came here——”</p>

<p>“A lady!” he interrupted eagerly. “What
kind of a one? Describe her personal appearance.
It may give me a clew.”</p>

<p>“She was not exactly a young woman, Frank;
nevertheless she was very beautiful in a Southern,
majestic style. Her eyes and hair were almost coal
black, and she spoke with a foreign accent. In
short, she looked like an Italian or Spaniard.”</p>

<p>The wretched man groaned aloud. Too well
he knew who his boy’s abductor was, and his conscience
told him that Lucille de Vigny’s conduct
was actuated by motives of revenge. She resented
his desertion, and took this means of telling
him so. He tottered to a chair, and sinking
down on it, hid his face in his hands. Were the
consequences of his imprudence ever to pursue
him? Oh! it was horrible, horrible.</p>

<p>“Frank,” said Mrs. Grandison, gazing at him
in alarm, “do you know the lady? Is she an
acquaintance of yours?”</p>

<p>He shuddered. “For my sins, yes. Would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
to God she were not! I have to thank Mme.
de Vigny for all my misery. If I had never set
eyes on that woman, Fenella and I might have
been living happily together at this moment. It
was she who came between us, curse her!”</p>

<p>“Mme. de Vigny!” exclaimed Helen, with a
red flush mantling in her cheek, “O Frank, if
only I had known, nothing on earth would have
induced me to give Ronny up into her charge.
Poor dear little Ronny! Why, she is an odious
woman—an abominable woman!”</p>

<p>“I quite agree,” he said moodily. “But abuse
cannot alter the fact of her having stolen my boy.
I can’t think, though, how you let him go.”</p>

<p>“She came here, Frank,” continued Mrs.
Grandison, in self-defense, “and some instinct
warned me against her. I refused at first to accede
to her request, but she was so urgent that
at last I believed she was really empowered by
you to take Ronny away. See, here is your card,
which she produced in token of the genuineness
of her errand.” And so saying, Helen turned to
the mantelpiece and showed Frank his card. He
looked at it, then snatched up his hat and prepared
to leave.</p>

<p>“This is a bad business,” he said tremulously.
“A very bad business, indeed; I would not have
had it happen for a year’s income. But perhaps
you can tell me where Mme. de Vigny is to be
found?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Alas! no. She left no address, and I haven’t
the faintest notion where she resides. But stay,”
putting her hand up to her forehead, “if I remember
rightly, Mme. de Vigny did hint at
traveling abroad and taking a long journey.
Why, Frank, how impetuous you are!” as her
visitor opened the door. “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Going!” he replied, his face all working with
emotion. “I am going straight to London to
engage a detective to hunt out Mme. de Vigny’s
whereabouts, and after that I intend returning to
Guernsey. Fenella is lying dangerously ill of
brain fever. We do not know what turn her illness
may take. The doctor thought that the
sight of Ronny might do her good, but now—now,”
breaking down suddenly, “I must go back
alone, so help me God.” And without wishing
Mrs. Grandison good-by, he rushed downstairs.</p>

<p>Helen looked after his retreating form with the
tears springing to her eyes. “Poor Frank!”
she sighed, “how he loves Fenella. And yet she
has completely spoilt his life. He was such a
bright, nice boy once upon a time. It quite
makes one’s heart ache to see him as he is now.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br>

BY RICHARD DOWLING.<br>
<br>
<small>DERELICT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Francis found himself in the train
on his way up to London from Felixstowe his
mind was in a condition bordering on frenzy. The
wife of his youth, the wife of his choice, the only
woman to whom his heart had ever gone forth
with unalloyed joy and limitless bounty, lay at
death’s door, from which one hope existed of
beckoning her back—the touch of their child’s
tiny hand. And now, at this moment of supreme
crisis, cursed Fate stepped in and took the child
from his sight, snatched the possible deliverer
from his arms!</p>

<p>Cursed Fate, or Nemesis, or <i>lex talionis</i>, call it
what one might, there was the maddening fact,
the overwhelming act of that foreign woman
whom once, in his malignant perversity, he
thought he loved, who over and over again swore
she loved him and only him! Granted he had
treated her badly, had he attempted her life?
Why, then, should she attempt his? Why
should she seek to kill him through the hearts he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
held most dear? Because he had made love to
her and ridden away? Great Heavens! Was
his sin against her a mustard seed to the whole
world, in comparison to this attempt on Fenella’s
life?</p>

<p>From the beginning of their acquaintance,
Lucille knew he was married—at no time of their
acquaintance did he know much of her. She had
her dark eyes, and her mystery, and her history—these
were parts of her fascination. She had enslaved
him, as a drug or wine might enslave him,
for a time; but she had never touched the essence
of his being—that was for Fenella, for Fenella
only.</p>

<p>When he reached London he drove straight to
Scotland Yard. If he had been in a normal state
he would no doubt have paid a visit to his solicitors
first, but he was in no normal state. He
could not have told when he ate last, or where he
had slept; what day of the week or month it was.
All that was usual was worthless, and only the
quest he was on worthy of heed.</p>

<p>At Scotland Yard he was at once shown into
the presence of Inspector Brown. His father’s
position made his name illustrious; the murder
trial had made himself notorious.</p>

<p>“My child—my boy of six—has been stolen.
His mother, Lady Francis, is in danger of death
from illness, and the instant recovery of the boy
is a matter of life and death. She is in brain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
fever, and the doctor says if her boy is at her
bedside when she recovers her senses it may save
her life. Whatever sum of money may be necessary
to recover the boy I’ll double it, treble it,
quadruple it, if you only find him for me, and at
once,” he cried out to the inspector, all in a
breath.</p>

<p>“The recovery of the child does not, unfortunately,
depend on mere money, my lord.”</p>

<p>“On what, then?”</p>

<p>“On possibility. If it is possible to be done it
will be done; and whether we succeed or fail, you
may rely on no time being lost. Will your lordship
kindly give me all the particulars?”</p>

<p>The father told the history of the boy’s abduction,
as Mrs. Grandison had given it to him.</p>

<p>“And this foreign, handsome lady who took
the child away, do you happen to know her
name?”</p>

<p>Did he happen to know Lucille’s name! Good
Heavens, how strange such a question seemed!
But it was one thing to know her name, and vow
hatred of her, and another thing to give to the
police the name of a woman he once made love
to. He hesitated.</p>

<p>The inspector looked up from the sheet of
paper on which he had been taking down the
particulars.</p>

<p>The inspector, believing the other had not
heard, repeated the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Bah!” thought Lord Francis, “why should I
hesitate? She has not hesitated to lie and to
steal Ronny; and Fenella’s life is in the scales.”
He said aloud: “The lady is French;” the inspector
recommenced writing; “her name is
Mme. de Vigny.”</p>

<p>The inspector looked up again, this time with
a start, laid down his pen, and cleared his throat
as though to clear his mind. “May I ask your
lordship to repeat the name?”</p>

<p>“Mme. de Vigny—Lucille de Vigny. Do you
know anything of her?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the inspector, touching an
electric bell.</p>

<p>A policeman in uniform entered. The inspector
handed the man a slip of paper. The
constable withdrew. In a few moments he returned,
handed some documents to his superior
officer, and retired.</p>

<p>“Does your lordship happen to know anything
of this Mme. Lucille de Vigny before she came
to England a few years ago?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely nothing.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we are talking of the same lady”—the
inspector looked down at his papers—“a tall,
strikingly handsome, dark woman of about
thirty-five or forty now. She was in the Prospect
Hotel, Harrogate, at the time of the late tragic
occurrence there, though she was not herself
brought into the case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Yes, that is the lady.”</p>

<p>“Well, we do know something of her here.
We have been keeping an eye on her for a little
time at the request of the French police. A
French detective has been over here about her.
It was not until the day before yesterday, when
instructions came from Paris to act, that we knew
she had left the country.”</p>

<p>“Left the country!” cried Lord Francis, falling
back on his chair in consternation.</p>

<p>“Sailed for New York from Liverpool four
days ago. She is wanted in France for connection
with some wholesale swindling of a bank in
Lille four or five years ago. We lost sight of her
for a little while lately, but that we have just explained
by the fact that she recently went through
a form of marriage at a registry with a rich
American Senator, Colonel Clutterbuck. I say
went through a form of marriage, for her husband,
one of the clerks in the Lille bank, is now
in the hands of the French police. My lord, you
may make your mind easy about your boy. No
doubt he is the child who sailed with Colonel
and Mrs. Clutterbuck four days ago as Mrs.
Clutterbuck’s nephew, Roland Tyrrell, aged
six.”</p>

<p>“What is to be done now?” cried Lord Francis,
relieved at getting a clew to his boy, and in
despair at finding the child must already be half-way
across the Atlantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“She will be arrested on landing, and brought
back.”</p>

<p>“But the boy, my son?”</p>

<p>“If you wish it, we can cable, and have him
looked after for you. There will be a few days
lost in legal formalities in New York.”</p>

<p>“I’ll follow the boy. I’ll go by the next boat!”
and, with this resolution, and no thought of anything
else, he rushed away from Scotland Yard
for his chambers.</p>

<p>At his chambers he found everything as he had
left it weeks ago. Into a couple of portmanteaus
he bundled some clothes—any, no matter what,
he could put his hands on. Then he sat down to
think. His brain was in a whirl. Only one
thought had any value, any place in his mind—the
recovery of Ronny. On that depended all.
On that depended the life of Fenella, and his
own power of making reparation to her for all
she had gone through.</p>

<p>He had forgotten one thing at Scotland Yard.
The inspector had said they could cable to have
the boy taken care of for him. He had not asked
the inspector to do so. He sat down, and, with
a hand that shook so that he could hardly hold
the pen, he wrote to the inspector, begging
that a message might be sent by cable, bidding
them look after Ronny on his behalf in New
York. He marked the envelope “private,” for
there was plenty of time for the cable, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
wished the whole affair to be kept as quiet as
possible.</p>

<p>Then he had nothing else to do but to get forward.
He did not think of looking to see, or of
inquiring when the next boat left. Queenstown
was the point nearest to America, and, by the Irish
mail that night, he started for Cork.</p>

<p>It was not until he had been six hours plunging
through the Atlantic toward the New World,
in the huge ocean steamer, that he remembered
he had sent no word to Guernsey. But he dismissed
the omission from his mind as a matter
of no moment; “for,” thought he, “all the messages
in the world would not serve my poor girl
as she now is, and I am going to fetch the elixir
of life for her—our Ronny’s voice.”</p>

<p>At the moment that Lord Francis was soothing
his mind, and cheering his way with this encouraging
reflection, Inspector Brown, of Scotland
Yard, was writing to him, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>:</p>

<p>I hasten to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the day before
yesterday, which came after I left. It was marked “private,”
and, consequently, was not opened in the ordinary course.
I was absent on duty yesterday, and only got it just now. Hence
I could not answer it sooner. The French authorities have decided
that, having secured the so-called Mme. Lucille de Vigny’s
husband, and she having got off to America, they will not follow
her further for the present. She will, therefore, walk ashore free
out of the steamer, and, in the absence of formal instructions,
we shall be powerless to stop her. Hoping this may reach you in
time, I am, my lord, your humble servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Christopher Brown</span>, Inspector.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Meanwhile the struggle for life in that cottage
room in Guernsey had turned in favor of Fenella.
The doctor had given a guarded opinion when
Lord Francis made his frantic appeal to him.
Before her husband fronted the Western Ocean,
the wasted sufferer opened her eyes, and once
more looked out, through the glance of reason,
on the world where she had endured so much.</p>

<p>For a day or two she hung between life and
death. She looked too frail for this world. But
she had store of the best of medicines in her
own blood—youth—and she began to mend
rapidly.</p>

<p>Happily, when she came to herself, she did not
clearly remember the dreadful past. All was dim
and shadowy. The doctor was careful to say
nothing that could renew her sorrow. He was
aware that her husband had set off to recover the
boy, but since Lord Francis dashed out of the place
no word had come from him, and as the patient
made no inquiries the doctor held his peace. The
nurse knew nothing, and Fenella herself had a
vague feeling that the past, whatever was in it,
had better be let alone. She was too weak for
conflict, for even consecutive thought.</p>

<p>Hour after hour she lay, weak and silent and
gentle, the ghost of her former self, all the old
audacious sprightliness vanished. She took what
they gave her, and spoke when she was spoken to,
and resisted nothing the attentive people around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
ordained for her. She did not ask questions.
She had no memory of her husband’s penitential
visit; no means of knowing that he had gone to
fetch their child.</p>

<p>The doctor seeing that she was in no distress
left her in the hands of beneficent Nature. Peace
was the finest cordial his patient could taste now,
and if she showed no sign of joyousness, she was
easy and at rest.</p>

<p>Fenella’s brain being free of the fever, her
splendid constitution and her youth asserted their
prerogative to lead her to health, and the kindly
doctor stood amazed at the progress she made toward
convalescence. “You have nothing to do
now but get well,” said he, “and you are getting
well as if getting well were a fever in full power.
You are building up as fast—ay, faster—than you
lost.”</p>

<p>She answered only with a smile. She took no
particular interest in getting well, or in anything
else, for that matter. Although the brain may
have been relieved from the ravages of active
disease, it was inert, lifeless. The fountains of
memory were still frozen, or dried up. She knew
she lay at her cottage in Guernsey, but she did
not actively realize why she was there. She felt
that if she made a great effort, she could tell herself
the story of her presence upon the island;
but she was languid, and took no interest in anything,
not even in herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“You may sit up for an hour to-morrow,” said
the doctor, one day.</p>

<p>She said: “Thank you, doctor.” He was careful
not to call her by any name, and he told the
nurse and maids not to address her as “Mrs.
Orme.” “Let us get the body strong first,”
thought he. “Until word comes from Lord
Francis, we have nothing pleasant to say to her,
and she may forget that she was ever ‘Mrs.
Orme.’”</p>

<p>So day slid into morrow, and brought no news—no
word of any kind—and Lord Francis was a
whole week gone, and the sufferer was allowed to
move about a little. The good doctor concluded
that Lord Francis had changed his intention
again, and for some reason or other reverted to
the condition of mind he had been in when he
borrowed Lord Castleton’s yacht, and took himself
away into southern seas beyond the voice of
England.</p>

<p>On the eighth day a letter came from London.
It was addressed in a clerkly hand. It was the
first letter that had come for Fenella since she had
fallen ill. She was sitting in an armchair by the
fire when she took it from the doctor, for he had
given strict orders she was to get no letter except
from his hand. The superscription was in such
commonplace clerkly writing that the good doctor
made sure that it was some ordinary business
communication, one from her lawyer or trustee, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
some other person connected with the routine of
her affairs. She was now strong enough to stroll
a short distance out-of-doors, and had taken a turn
in the garden the day before, and was to walk a
mile along the road later to-day when the sun
grew stronger.</p>

<p>“A letter from some of your business people,”
said the man of science. “I hope it brings you
good news.” A little rousing would not come
amiss to the lovely invalid.</p>

<p>It was addressed to “Mrs. Orme.” She broke
the cover. It contained a brief note from her
lawyer and a letter inclosed, the writing of which,
a woman’s, was unfamiliar to her. The lawyer’s
letter ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:</p>

<p>I inclose a letter which reaches me from an unknown source,
with an anonymous request that it may be forwarded to you. I
am, dear madam, yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Thornhill</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The letter inclosed was addressed to “Lady
Francis Onslow.” She broke the cover of that.
It, too, was short. It ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your husband has left you forever, and I have taken care you
shall never see your child again.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lucille de Vigny.</span></p>
</div>

<p>That was all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br>

BY MRS. HUNGERFORD.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fenella</span> rose to her feet. There had been
one terrible moment when all things faded from
her, but she overcame that. She <i>would</i> not faint!
She turned to the doctor, who, watching her anxiously,
now came a step nearer to her. In truth,
her face, always colorless, was now ghastly; but
there was a sudden strength in her eyes, her whole
demeanor, that betokened, as it were, a new life
within her. Lately, so weak she had been, she
had fainted at any small thing that fell into her
path threatening to annoy her; but now, when
she had reached the most momentous point of
her life, her hardihood returned to her, and the
old, sweet, girlish gayety, that might almost be
termed audacity, developed into a courage true
and noble.</p>

<p>This was no time for weakness. Now was the
hour to rise and assert herself! If this devilish
letter meant that evil machinations were at work
to deprive her of her husband and her child, now
was the time to fling aside all considerations and
fight for her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Her own! <i>were</i> they her own? A terrible remembrance
of the past when he, Frank, had been
untrue to her, returned again. What if he should
be untrue <i>again</i>! And again with that woman!
Her heart for a second died within her, but
another thought restored her to herself. Her
child! Her darling! Her Ronny! He, at least,
was all her own. She need fear no rival in his
affections.</p>

<p>There was something so tragic in the expression
of her young, beautiful face that the old doctor
went closer to her and touched her arm as though
to rouse her.</p>

<p>“What is it, my dear?” asked he nervously.
He had grown very fond of her during these past
weeks, when she hovered between life and death.</p>

<p>“Read that!” said she, holding out to him the
fatal letter. She let her eyes rest full on his—the
lovely eyes now so much too large for the
pale, small face. Her long white robe fell to her
feet, showing but too plainly the attenuation of
her figure. She looked like some tall, sad, mediæval
saint, with her white clinging garments and
her nimbus of red-brown hair.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens!” said the kind little doctor,
letting the letter flutter to his feet. “But what
can this mean? Your husband—so devoted as
he seemed—and—— Who is this woman, then?
This Mme. de Vigny?”</p>

<p>“A fiend,” said Fenella softly, bitterly. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
I shall overcome her yet. Give me a paper, a
telegram form, ink—I”—excitedly—“I have a
friend who will help me. <i>One</i> friend,” she turned
and looked piteously at the old man. “I have
only one friend in all the world,” said she, “and
he—distrusts me.”</p>

<p>“You have another,” said the good old doctor
stoutly, “in me. And I do not distrust you.
Come! come now, my dear. Take courage.
Here are pens and paper. Let us telegraph to
this distrustful, if useful, friend of yours.”</p>

<p>Fenella wrote rapidly, and handed the telegram
to the doctor. He read it aloud:</p>

<p>“Come to me at once. Great trouble! Make
no delay, I implore you?”</p>

<p>Having read it, he went back to the address—“Clitheroe
Jacynth!”</p>

<p>“Jacynth!—a distinguished man. One almost
unconquerable, they say now. I congratulate you
if you have <i>him</i> on your side.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but you forget!”</p>

<p>“Tut—when he comes I shall speak to him. I
shall dissolve all doubts,” said the little man
kindly. “And now to dispatch this at once. I
shall take it myself, if you will promise to lie
down and try to rest for awhile.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” said she meekly, but it was a
promise vain indeed. The door once closed behind
him, she began her dreadful walk up and
down, up and down the room. She felt half mad.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
Her child—her little one, in that woman’s power.
It was noticeable that in this hour all her thoughts
went to the child.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Hullo, Jacynth! This you? By Jove! what
mad haste. Not even a word for an old friend?”</p>

<p>“Why, Castleton! What brings you here?”</p>

<p>“Folly! Folly only, if it must be told,” said
Lord Castleton, dismally. “Sentiment is folly;
isn’t it, Jacynth? Yet a sentimental desire to
know how the Onslows are going on is driving
me back to Guernsey—a spot I quitted a week
ago.”</p>

<p>“To Guernsey! Why, that is where I am going
too. Have you heard anything?” He looked
eagerly at his companion. “Do you know anything?
I have had a telegram from—from her.
Can <i>you</i> explain it?”</p>

<p>“A telegram! When?”</p>

<p>“A few hours ago. Look here, Castleton. I
honestly think you are a friend of Lady Francis
Onslow’s—read this.”</p>

<p>“I am a friend of both the Onslows,” said Castleton
deliberately. He meant what he said.
He took the telegram and glanced at it.</p>

<p>“Same old game!” said he at last, lifting his
brows. “Another quarrel, I suppose. I thought
when they came together this time that they
meant business, but it seems not. How few
married people are suited to each other!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“I never thought much of Onslow,” said Jacynth
slowly. “A weak character at all times,
I suppose nobody would dispute the fact of his
having been unfaithful to his wife?”</p>

<p>“With Mme. de Vigny? Pouf! There were
faults on both sides.”</p>

<p>“On Mme. de Vigny’s and his? Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. On his and Lady Francis’. She
certainly led him a life.”</p>

<p>“A life he deserved! <i>He</i>—married to <i>her</i>.”
He looked suddenly at his companion, and the
touch of passion in his eyes revealed <i>all</i> things.
“To that poor, sweet, pretty girl. <i>He</i> to play
fast and loose with her, a child just out of her
schoolroom. It”—he paused and commanded
himself—“In my opinion it was contemptible.”</p>

<p>“You give yourself away a good deal,” said
Castleton, who looked amused—who looked, indeed,
as if he would like to laugh. He had a
great affection for Jacynth, who was rather a
special sort of man, and in spite of his mirth felt
sorry for him. “You are, I presume, on the side
of Lady Francis.”</p>

<p>“That would be an impertinence from any
man but you,” said Jacynth moodily. “There
is no need to go into it, however. Whether I
love her or not is no matter. It”—miserably—“can
<i>never</i> matter now. What I <i>do</i> is—to pity
her with all my soul.”</p>

<p>“Because of her marriage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Jacynth looked at him as if hesitating.</p>

<p>“For that too,” said he deliberately. “She
married, in my opinion, the last man in the
world who would have made her really happy.
But my pity did not run that way. I was
thinking of that miserable trial and its consequences.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she was a trifle too magnanimous there,”
said Castleton, believing the other knew all about
it. “It would have been better, to my way of
thinking, if she had told the broad truth, and let
Onslow take his chance.”</p>

<p>“His chance!” said Jacynth, staring at him.</p>

<p>“Certainly; it wasn’t so bad a chance. He
might, he positively <i>would</i> have got off all right.
But she chose to take the guilt on her own
shoulders, and now she has created an enigma
very difficult of solution.”</p>

<p>“You mean——” Jacynth paused; he seemed
gasping for breath.</p>

<p>“I mean——” suddenly Lord Castleton grew
silent, and gazed at his companion with a troubled
countenance. “Do <i>you</i> mean,” said he, “that
you didn’t know? Why, you conducted the case
for <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing,” said Jacynth, with great
agitation. “If you can throw any honest light on
the matter, do it, I entreat you.”</p>

<p>“I hardly know whether I should. I”—Castleton
drew back from him—“I was so sure you knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
that——my dear fellow, <i>pray</i> forget what I have
said.”</p>

<p>“I shall forget nothing,” said Jacynth sturdily.
“I should advise you not to forget either. Look
here, Castleton,” catching his arm, “is it advisable
to forget? Who knows what this telegram
may mean? We are both friends of hers.”</p>

<p>“Are you a friend of <i>his</i>?”</p>

<p>“No! Why should I disguise the truth? I
have told you before how I regard him. But what
has that got to do with it?”</p>

<p>“You are prejudiced.”</p>

<p>“I am not. If you <i>have</i> anything to disclose,
Castleton, disclose it! I may be of use to
you——” He hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well, considering she has sent for you, I suppose
she means to tell you herself,” said Castleton.
“And,” reluctantly, “it is well you should
know beforehand what there is to know, though
I am surprised that she has not already told you.”
To him there was but one certainty, and that was
that Fenella had betrayed to Onslow the part he
took in the fatal night’s work that murdered De
Mürger. Probably Onslow had resented what
she told him, and disbelieved it, and she had
then sent for her lawyer. What else could demand
so imperative a telegram? On the instant
he opened his heart to Jacynth, and told him all
his belief, all his doubts.</p>

<p>“I could never forget,” said he, “how he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in the last hypnotic fit, and hypnotic is the fashionable
word for it, I know, but I call it madness.
And his heart isn’t sound, you know. He inherits
disease in that direction. His father died of
aneurism of the heart. Some day he will have a
fashionable fit too strong for him, and there will
be an end.”</p>

<p>“The best thing that could happen for both of
them,” said Jacynth deliberately. He had been
terribly upset by Castleton’s revelation, and
though hardly permitting himself to believe in it,
still felt a wild, mad joy in the thought that she—<i>she</i>,
the only woman the whole wide world contained
for him—might be innocent of bloodshed
after all. “See here,” said he vehemently, “if
this thing be true, if she saw him commit that
crime—for crime it was—do you think they could
ever live happily together in the future? Why,
think, man, would she not see the color of blood
upon his hands, would she fail to rank him among
murderers? And he——”</p>

<p>“Why, he knows nothing.”</p>

<p>“True; and therein lies the real tragedy.
Knowing nothing, he thinks of <i>her</i> as a murderess.
There it lies, you see, in a nutshell. <i>He</i> thinks <i>her</i>,
<i>she</i> thinks <i>him</i> guilty of a ghastly crime, and you
madly believe they could live together happily.”</p>

<p>“It need not go on like that; she might tell
him the truth.”</p>

<p>“She? Never!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“At all events, he might learn it.”</p>

<p>“And if so, what would be gained? The world
would shun them both; and they were made for
the world. We are all made for the world.”</p>

<p>“True.” A shrill whistle aroused them both.
“Come on, the train is about to start,” said
Castleton.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As Jacynth entered her sitting room, Fenella
rose and ran toward him.</p>

<p>“At last, at last!” she said. The words came
in a sort of gasp. Jacynth, holding her hands,
stared at her, shocked at the change in her appearance.
Every vestige of color was gone from
her face, her eyes looked wild, and her parted lips
were very pale. She had pushed back her hair
from her forehead with a quick gesture, just as
he entered the room. She was at her worst this
moment, but the man’s love was so strong that
he failed to see that. He thought her lovely—lovely
always, and what was strange, even
younger than she used to be.</p>

<p>“You know, you have heard,” she went on, her
tone feverish.</p>

<p>“You forget!” said he gently, with a view to
calming her agitation. “I know nothing. I have
had only your telegram, and that was so vague.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You shall see another telegram then.
That,” thrusting Mme. de Vigny’s into his hand,
“<i>that</i> is not vague at all events.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Jacynth read it carefully. He frowned.
“That woman again!” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes. Again.” She stood back from him.
“Do you believe he has gone back to her? <i>Do</i>
you? Do you?” The very vehemence of her
question conveyed to him the knowledge that
she thought he had gone back.</p>

<p>“There is only this,” said he, striking the
paper. “And it is from <i>her</i>. She is not the
woman to believe in.”</p>

<p>“No! But I have thought it out for all that,
and——” She paused and pressed her hands to
her head. Jacynth gently led her to a seat. She
looked exhausted. “He left me,” said she presently—“to
find my child and bring him to me.
He came back, and there was no child with him.
I was ill then—very ill. I could not think, but
for all that, I <i>knew</i>. Then he went away again,
and I waited—waited. Great Heaven!” said she,
clasping her hands, “if you only knew what it was
to wait like that for a sight of your child! and
then there came—<i>that</i>!” She pointed to the
telegram that he still held. “Well, what do you
think?” asked she in a low voice, bending forward.</p>

<p>“It is hard to think——”</p>

<p>“No, it is not!” He was horrified by the
change in her tone, and looked at her. She was
still bending forward, her hands clasped, her
young, sweet face as hard as misery could make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
it. “It is the easiest thing,” she said. “He met
her again, I suppose—I think, and together they
have gone away, taking my child with them.
Oh!” She sprang to her feet, and flung out her
arms. “Oh! the child! He might have gone—gone
forever. It would be hard, for I loved him;
but to take the child from me! The child! My
darling! My baby! Do you know how many
months I have lived without my little sweetheart?
You, you of all men know!” She turned
to him, and caught him by the arm. “Ever since
that awful trial! I gave him up then, my little
one; and for what?” she almost hissed out the
words—“<i>to shield his father!</i>”</p>

<p>“You mean——” said Jacynth, his heart beating;
was he now to hear the truth from her own
lips? But the sound of his voice broke in upon
her passion, and checked her.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said she quickly, “except that—that
he is false to me.”</p>

<p>“I tell you again not to dwell too much on
that,” said Jacynth slowly. Although his whole
life seemed to depend upon it, he could not
refrain from pleading his rival’s cause. “You
have only that woman’s word for it. This telegram
may be a fabrication from beginning to end.”</p>

<p>“A curiously well-timed one,” she laughed, in a
cruelly miserable way. “If she knew nothing of
him, how did she learn that my child and my
husband were now away from me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“More curious things have been explained,”
said he.</p>

<p>“You! <i>you</i> talk to me like this?” cried she passionately.
“<i>You</i> would defend him! <i>You!</i> who
knew he was once untrue? You”—faintly—“who
once loved me?”</p>

<p>“I shall be your friend always,” said he, putting
a great constraint upon himself. “It is because I
<i>am</i> your friend that I speak thus; why not look
at it in another light? You say your husband
left you hurriedly; you say that Mme. de Vigny
must have known of his absence from you, and
also of your boy’s. It might be that she, out of
revenge, stole the boy, and that your husband is
now pursuing her with a view of restoring him to
you.”</p>

<p>He said this more to gain time than anything
else, little thinking that he had guessed the truth,
and had laid before her the exact facts of the
case.</p>

<p>“A fairy tale,” said she mournfully. “No!
He lied to me the last time I saw him. When I
asked him to bring me my child, he said he was
tired—asleep. I, too, was tired, worn-out from
sickness and a broken heart, and too weak to do
aught but believe him. The child was not here
at all!” She stepped back from Jacynth, and
covered her face with her hands. “Oh, my
Ronny! My beloved! Oh, my little child!”
She took down her hands. Her lips were trembling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
“Mr. Jacynth, what shall I do?” said
she.</p>

<p>“The first thing to do,” said he harshly, “is
to keep up your courage.” He spoke in a queer,
grating tone. He knew if he once gave way, he
should betray himself. Betray the wild, mad
longing he felt to take her in his arms, and press
her poor, sweet, pretty head down upon his
breast, and try with all his soul to comfort her.
“You are condemning your husband unheard.
Is that fair? Is it just?”</p>

<p>“He has not been just to me!”</p>

<p>“True! And, therefore, you find it difficult
in such a crisis as this to believe in him.” He
looked at her suddenly. “Still you love him?”
said he. The words were a question.</p>

<p>“Do I?” said she. <i>Her</i> words were also a question
addressed to her own heart. “I feel so tired,
so tired,” she said. “It has been a struggle always,
and through many things I loved him, I——”
She hesitated. “I despise myself,” she said,
“but I think I love him still!” A pang shot
through Jacynth’s heart. He did not note the
suggestion of doubt in her voice. “I love him, I
think,” she went on slowly, “<i>I think</i>, but this I
<i>know</i>, I distrust him.”</p>

<p>“Distrust means ruin,” said Jacynth.</p>

<p>“To what? To love?”</p>

<p>“To all things.”</p>

<p>“To friendship?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Yes. To all things.”</p>

<p>She went close to him.</p>

<p>“That is not true,” she said. “You are befriending
me now, yet you distrust me.”</p>

<p>“I? No! You are thinking of that wretched
trial!” He spoke with extreme agitation.
“But I have heard all.”</p>

<p>“<i>All?</i>”</p>

<p>“Yes! <i>All.</i> And if ever a man craved
another’s pardon upon his knees, I crave yours.”</p>

<p>“All?” repeated she faintly. She seemed to
have heard that one word only.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he. He let his voice sink to a
whisper, he leaned toward her. “Who killed De
Mürger?” asked he.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“It is true!” said he presently, when she had
told him all. “It is true that the world still produces
heroines. It is now more imperative than
ever that Lord Francis should be found.”</p>

<p>“For what?” said she. “Do you think I
should betray him now—even now? Ah! Mr.
Jacynth, you do not know me. No! I shall go
to my grave bearing this burthen. After
all”—sadly—“he once <i>did</i> love me!”</p>

<p>“If he has gone off with that woman again I
don’t see why you should spare him,” said Jacynth.
“But, as I have said, I hope for the best
about that. In the meantime——”</p>

<p>She interrupted him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“In the meantime, find my child!” said she.
She was still ghastly pale, but a little fire had
come into her eyes. “Bring <i>him</i> back to me, get
him back from that woman. Oh!” a little
nervously, “I have no right to speak to you
like this. Why should I order you about?
Only—only—you are kind—kind always, and—I
have now no friends! And Ronny—Ronny
always hated strangers! Oh! my child, my little
heart!” She broke down suddenly, and burst
into violent weeping. “O God!” cried she,
“what shall I do? That woman! That woman,
if she has him, she will kill him! He, who never
knew anything but love? My little lamb! Oh!
his eyes, his laugh! <i>You</i> saw him! Was there
<i>ever</i> so pretty a boy? Oh! once—once”—passionately—“you
said you loved me! <i>Help</i> me
now! Tell me how I shall <i>begin</i> to search for
Ronny.”</p>

<p>“You would go yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes! Oh, if you only <i>knew</i> what this
last day and night have been!” She was sobbing
violently, but now, by a supreme effort, she controlled
herself; she took down her hands from her
face, and pressed them against her throbbing
bosom. “I will be calm,” she said, “this is no
time for tears, and you must not think me weak.
I am strong—very strong. Tell me now how I
shall begin.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” said he, “but you must try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
and see my plan as I see it. Now, it seems to me
impossible that you, in your weak health, just
recovered from a dangerous illness, could possibly
institute such a troublesome search as this is
likely to prove.”</p>

<p>“And if not?” began she despairingly.</p>

<p>“There is a substitute,” said he. “<i>I</i> shall undertake
this matter.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If you will intrust this affair to me, I
will promise to bring you back your—husband.”</p>

<p>“Bring me back my child,” said she.</p>

<p>“Fenella! your husband! you will want to
have <i>him</i> back!”</p>

<p>“I have told you I am tired,” said she
coldly. “I have borne a great deal, and——”
she paused.</p>

<p>“There is something on your mind,” said he.</p>

<p>“His hands!” she said. She seemed to shrink
visibly. She shuddered. “<i>The blood!</i> I was
unconscious then, I think—and it is only now—now—— But
his hands! and his face! Great
Heavens, how he <i>held</i> him. He choked him! It
was as if he was over there now,” staring wildly
at the far part of the room. “His fingers closed
round his throat, and there was such a sound—<i>a
gurgle</i>—Heaven, what a sound! and then he
stabbed, and stabbed, and <i>stabbed</i>—he was mad.
Oh!” with a long-drawn, piercing sigh, “<i>I</i> shall
go mad if I think of it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Then don’t think,” said Jacynth. He caught
hold of her arm and shook her sharply.</p>

<p>“Whenever I see him I see blood,” said she,
still trembling.</p>

<p>“Never mind him, think of your child,” said
he, with a desire to rouse her. “Am I to start
now? and when I find him, what message am I to
give him from his mother?”</p>

<p>He had roused her indeed. “A message!” she
said. The old, sad, dreadful fear in her face died
away. Hope lit it into a lovely life. “A message
to Ronny!” she cried.</p>

<p>She fell on her knees before Jacynth and took
his hand and laid her cold cheek upon it, a cheek
wet with tears. “Tell him his mother loves him,”
said she. “Tell him, too, that his mother will
forever love the one who will restore him to her.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br>

BY ARTHUR A’BECKETT.<br>
<br>
<small>IN NEW YORK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Clutterbuck</span>, the newly-married wife
of Colonel Clutterbuck, of New York, was not
“at home” to visitors. She had given orders to
that effect, but the command was superfluous as
there were no callers. To tell the truth, Mme.
de Vigny had not been a great social success in
the country of her adoption. The Senator, her
husband, had married her to preside over his
establishment, and to gracefully adorn his dinner
table, and although she had accepted both duties,
the result had been disappointment. Mrs. Clutterbuck’s
notion of looking after a house was to
take the minimum amount of trouble, and order
the maximum amount of goods. She had run up
bills in all directions, giving a special preference
to the stores of jewelers, dressmakers, and venders
of lace. Her idea of dispensing hospitality
was scarcely in accord with the colonel’s notions
on the same matter. The Senator, who was a
power in Wall Street, firmly believed that more
could be done over the viands and iced water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
than in the place of custom, and was in the habit
of filling his dining room with people who could
be useful. His desire was, of course, to conciliate
those he invited by adopting a tone of business-like
geniality, but he received no assistance from
his wife, whose solitary aim seemed to be the
unprovoked and contemptuous snubbing of her
husband’s guests.</p>

<p>“Loo-cill,” said he one day after a banquet
had ended in disaster, “I guess you are not particular
to company. Guess, madame, you prefer
solitude to some of the best-known persons in the
United States.”</p>

<p>“If you mean by that,” replied Mrs. Clutterbuck,
admiring herself in a mirror, “I do not care
for the vulgar crowd you ask to dinner, you are
certainly right. They are neither polished nor
amusing.”</p>

<p>“Strikes me, madame, that you seem to feel the
want of the British aristocracy. You can’t get
on without them—that is so. It seems a pity
that Lord Francis Onslow should be on the
other side of the Atlantic. He would have
been a decided acquisition to our family circle.
See?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Lucille, with her
large eyes fixed upon the colonel menacingly.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“What I say,” retorted the colonel. “I do
not want, madame, any unpleasantness, but I give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
you fair warning that I know a thing or two. I
have special sources of information.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to insult me?” Lucille asked in
a low tone, raising her head, and still keeping her
steady gaze upon her husband, her eyes looking
into his eyes, as if they would read his very soul.</p>

<p>“Come, come, madame, none of that,” cried
Clutterbuck, waving her off. “I tell you, Loo-cill,
I was not born yesterday, nor yet the day
before. My will is a pretty strong one, and I tell
you distinctly I am not a subject. I have been
tried before, and it would not do. So take my
word, madame, you are giving yourself a great
deal of trouble for nothing. Take my advice,
madame, and drop it. Guess it won’t do.”</p>

<p>She seemed to concentrate her power of will
into a supreme and final effort, and then she
shrank back into a <i>fauteuil</i>—conquered. Her
husband laughed, and continued:</p>

<p>“You see you cannot contrive it. No, madame,
it won’t do. So, if you take my advice, I
would not try it again. You see it just riles me,
and I am not a nice man to rile. I love and
respect all ladies, but I have a sharp and short
way of reckoning with snakes. See?”</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment and then burst
into a hysterical laugh. “There,” continued her
husband, “you notice you are unhinged. It is
not good for you, this kind of excitement. And
now tell me, how is Ronny? Why did he not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
come down to give his uncle good-morning before
I started for business to-day?”</p>

<p>“Ronny has gone,” replied Lucille shortly.</p>

<p>“Gone,” exclaimed the Senator. “Why, where
have you sent him?”</p>

<p>“That is my business,” returned Mrs. Clutterbuck.
“Surely I have a right to do what I please
with my own nephew.”</p>

<p>“Nephew,” echoed he. “Whew!”</p>

<p>“Have you any reason for questioning the
relationship?”</p>

<p>“Well, no,” replied her husband, stroking his
beard; “but it strikes me for so near a relative,
the lad does not seem to care particularly about
you. Why, I do believe he likes me better than
he does you.”</p>

<p>“Ronny has bad taste.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, madame, maybe,” returned her husband.
“But you might keep a civil tongue in
your head. It’s that kind of thing that riles my
guests.”</p>

<p>“What kind of thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, drop it. Now tell me, when do you
expect Ronny’s return?”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect it at all.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see you are not in a communicative
mood, so I shall take myself off. But see here,
madame. You were intended by Nature for the
leisure class, but in the States we haven’t got the
institution. Some day we may import it from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Europe, and if we do, why then you will find
yourself quite at home. But, until we do import
it from Europe, take a word of advice. Climb
down, madame, climb down.”</p>

<p>And with this parting shot the colonel took his
departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clutterbuck listened to the retreating
steps, and then went to her desk. She sat down
in front of the table and pondered. Had she
acted wisely? Certainly it was advisable to quit
England—Europe—but was not this a case of
from the frying-pan into the fire? The colonel was
a man of violent passions, and she felt that she was
absolutely without influence over him. He was
too strong for her. She had been accustomed to
do what she liked with members of the opposite
sex; here was a man who set her at defiance,
laughed her to scorn. What was she to do? She
was absolutely dependent upon him for support.
Unless she could get back to Europe (which was
not a desirable spot for the moment), or find a
traveling Englishman, she was powerless. Her
husband’s friends and acquaintances appeared to
hold her in abhorrence. Besides, manners and
customs on one side of the Atlantic seemed to differ
from customs and manners on the other. It
was not a cheerful prospect. However, there was
nothing to be done but to submit and to keep her
eyes open to take immediate advantage of any
chance that might offer itself. So she sat down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
before the little table, and unlocking her desk examined
its contents. There were a few letters
written in faded ink, and tears gathered in her eyes
as she glanced at them.</p>

<p>“He loved me once,” she said with a sigh, “and
I absolutely loved him; yes, loved him. Well,
that is past. He has abandoned me as he abandoned
her, and I can strike them both through
their boy.”</p>

<p>Then she took out a letter that bore the New
York postmark of the day before, and read it
through from end to end. It was a long letter
and seemed to give her satisfaction. “I do not
see how they can recover the boy,” she murmured,
“and, if this programme is carried out in
the future, he should be as much lost to his family
as a grain of sand in a desert or a needle in a
bundle of hay.”</p>

<p>Then she considered whether she should burn
the letter or return it to her desk. She decided
upon the latter course, and placed it for greater
security in the concealed recesses of a secret
drawer. The rest of the afternoon she spent listlessly
in reading novels with yellow covers and
playing on the piano. She had no visitors.
When the dinner hour arrived the colonel had
not reappeared. However, this did not greatly
disturb her, as it was his custom on occasions to
stay away from home, but when he decided to
dine elsewhere he usually communicated through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the telephone his intentions. He had neglected
to do this, so Mrs. Clutterbuck decided, upon her
own responsibility, to dine alone. She gave the
necessary orders, and in due course the meal was
served and discussed. After the things had been
removed (she had taken her dinner in the boudoir)
she lighted a cigarette. It was not a habit
which met with her husband’s encouragement,
but as he was not there to upbraid her she saw no
reason why she should not indulge her taste for
the fumes of nicotine. A little later the door was
thrown open, and the colonel entered. He was
pale, and his features worked. Evidently, he was
in a violent passion.</p>

<p>“You are quite a stranger,” she said, with a
little laugh, “and I have dined without you. I
did not feel your loss, because the <i>suprême de
volaille</i> was excellent. You see I am smoking.
Take one?”</p>

<p>He deliberately seized the proffered cigarette-case,
and threw it with all his force against the
wall. She shrugged her shoulders and laughed
again. “What a child you are! You remind me
of Ronny, and yet you are no relative of his.”</p>

<p>“Are you a relative of his?” asked the colonel
slowly, weighing every word as if he were afraid
to trust his voice.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. Did I not tell you that he was
my nephew?”</p>

<p>“And did you not tell me a lie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>There was a pause, and they looked at one
another as a duelist regards an opponent—neither
anxious to begin, both on guard. Again
she laughed.</p>

<p>“You are not very cheerful company this evening.”</p>

<p>“Then I will make my visit as short as possible.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you are paying me a visit, are you? You
purpose obtaining a separation.”</p>

<p>“There is no necessity for a separation.”</p>

<p>“I see, then, you will obtain a divorce. I have
always been told that in America there are
special facilities for disjoining marriage ties. Is
New York a good place for that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“There is no necessity, madame, to dissolve
marriage ties.”</p>

<p>“You are very, very serious this evening,” said
Lucille, putting the cigarette in her mouth. “I
hate conundrums. All this afternoon I have
been worrying myself to find an answer to the
riddle, why I became your wife?”</p>

<p>“You never did become my wife,” replied the
colonel shortly.</p>

<p>Lucille turned pale, and then her face was
suffused with color. She rose to her full height.</p>

<p>“And you have come to tell me this?”</p>

<p>“Now, madame, see here; I don’t want any
heroics. I am going to take it quietly, and I
advise you to do the same. Now, what I have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
say is just this. I made a mistake in marrying
you.”</p>

<p>“The mistake was mutual.”</p>

<p>“Now, madame, there is no cause for interruption.
You shall have the story right away, and if
you have not enough of it by the time I have
done, it will be your fault and not mine. Look
you here, if I made a mistake you made a
greater. Have you ever heard of a crime called
bigamy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Lucille coolly. “It is a weakness
of mine—I committed bigamy when I married
you.”</p>

<p>“And you tell me that without turning a hair?”
exclaimed the American, fairly taken aback at
her audacity. “Then you know I could throw
you into jail, madame?”</p>

<p>“You can do nothing of the sort,” she returned.
“Now stop further explanation; you see
there is no necessity. I have saved you the
trouble of inflicting a long story on me with your
terrible nasal twang, and I am thankful.”</p>

<p>“Look you here, madame,” returned the colonel,
white with passion. “Don’t you rile me too
much. There is a limit, I tell you, and you have
about reached it and a bit over.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I am not in the least afraid of you. For
the reason that causes you not to hurl me into
jail will prevent you from murdering me. And
less than a murder would not do; even your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
countrymen don’t care about wife—I beg your
pardon—women-beaters.”</p>

<p>The colonel ground his teeth and clenched his
hands, but kept tranquil.</p>

<p>“Madame, you are right,” he said at last.
“Quite right, I am not going to murder you.
Anything of that sort I can leave to your husband—when
he gets out of prison. But to come
to business. If you take my advice you will
make tracks. I have had private information
that you have escaped by the skin of your teeth.
They have got your husband and they wanted
you, but the prosecutors seem to be economical,
and they are satisfied with him. So instead of
being taken to the Tombs on your arrival in New
York, you were allowed to come home with me.
And a nice home you have made it, madame,”
and he looked round the room crammed with
costly gimcracks. “It has cost me a pretty
penny.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” she replied calmly, “but you can
afford it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, fortunately, I can, madame. Salem Clutterbuck
is good for millions.”</p>

<p>“You had better not boast of your wealth, or
you will make me avaricious.”</p>

<p>“Avaricious! Why, what has my wealth to do
with you, madame? All that is past and gone.
We squared up when Mrs. Clutterbuck returned
to Mme. Vin-jay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“Not quite,” said Lucille with a cold smile.
“You must be a bad man of business, and yet
you have realized a fortune.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have made my pile, madame,” he returned,
with a vague feeling of uneasiness, “and
as to my being a man of business, why you just
ask anyone who knows me.”</p>

<p>“There is no necessity,” said Lucille, “because
I can test you myself. As a man of business,
how much do you intend to pay me to go away?”</p>

<p>The colonel indulged in a low whistle, and for
a moment regarded with absolute admiration the
woman he had for a time believed to be his wife.
Then he slowly produced his pocket-book, and
taking out some notes, placed them before her.
She took them up and reckoned the amount.
“Not bad for a first bid,” she observed, “and I
see you know how to deal. You are a better
man of business than I imagined. Say double,
and we will call it done.”</p>

<p>Again the Senator produced his pocket-book,
and once more extracted from its recesses some
notes. He placed these before Lucille, and she
took them up as before. Once again she arrived
at a total.</p>

<p>“You are satisfied I shall not disturb you,” she
asked. “You can trust me?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, madame, I can,” replied the colonel.
“You think quite rightly that I don’t want a
scandal. I don’t. But if there is to be one, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
may as well have it on a grand scale. If you
come back, madame, to annoy me, why then I
shall know that I may as well go in for the entire
cucumber, and act accordingly.”</p>

<p>“You will shoot me?”</p>

<p>“I guess it will come to that. You are a
woman of great discrimination. I shall remove
you, and I can do it with a better grace after you
have been away a bit. So you know what to
expect. And now, as we have had this friendly
chat, there is no reason why we should quarrel.
Loo-cill, here’s my hand.”</p>

<p>She burst into a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>“Do you think I am going to take it? If by
grasping it I could make it wither, I would seize
it and hold it to my heart.”</p>

<p>“Why, what have I done, madame?”</p>

<p>“Why, you have robbed me of my last chance.
If you had stood by me I might have pulled
through. Well, it will be pleasant reading to see
a report of your death.”</p>

<p>“I daresay it will,” said the colonel, biting his
lip until the blood came. “In the meantime you
can read this. And now, madame, I have to bid
you adoo.”</p>

<p>And laying down a marked paper before her,
he stalked away.</p>

<p>Lucille, left to herself, remained for some moments
buried in the deepest thoughts. What
should she do next? She had expected the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
storm, for she had felt that the discovery of her
past was only a question of time. So she was
not unprepared for the colonel’s desertion. She
had taken care to supply herself with a goodly
store of diamonds and precious stones, and
accordingly for the moment was not within the
reach of want. The bundle of notes she had
extracted from the Senator’s pocket-book represented
a considerable sum, and added to the
total of the value of her worldly goods. Then
she had her beauty. She looked into the mirror
and shuddered. What would her husband do
when he escaped from the prison walls? It was
the question she had asked herself a hundred
times. It was the question that had been suggested
to her not an hour ago. It would be a
terrible day of reckoning.</p>

<p>“He will kill me,” she muttered. “He has
more pluck than this blustering American. He
will kill me. Well, and if he does, what does it
matter?”</p>

<p>And then she took up the marked paper that
the Senator had left behind him, and glanced
carelessly through the paper until she came to
the column that bore the trace of ink. Then she
started back as if stung by an adder. The
marked passage told the world in general, and
the American capital in particular, that Lord
Francis Onslow, the husband of the acquitted
murderess, had lately arrived in New York.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>It was night-time in the chief American police
station before Frank could find an opportunity
for continuing his inquiries. On his arrival he
had quickly learned that Mrs. Clutterbuck had
not been arrested—that a telegram had been
received warning the officials to do nothing, as
their services were not required. And for the
moment, the chief officer whom he consulted
could tell him nothing more. He had been advised
to let matters take their course.</p>

<p>“You see,” said the chief, “we can’t do much
at present, sir. The colonel is highly respected
and a Senator, and until we have authority to
interfere with his arrangements we must hold our
hands. You say that the boy that accompanies
them is your son. Maybe it is so, but still the
lad is under the colonel’s protection, and we don’t
want to lend ourselves to an abduction case. It
would be giving ourselves away.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you the boy belongs to me.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he does and maybe he doesn’t. The
word of Colonel Clutterbuck is as good as yours,
and while the lad is in his custody I don’t see
how we can help you. If you take our advice
you will let matters slide for awhile. We will
keep our eyes upon the household, and if we find
him taken out of the custody of the lady who
says she is his aunt, why then we will communicate
with you, and then will be the time for you
to come upon the scene. At present, you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
pardon me, sir—I should say my lord—you are
what I may call a superfluity.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse to help me?” said Frank
angrily.</p>

<p>“Well, that is not quite as I want to put it,”
replied the officer of police, “but I guess it’s
about the true meaning. Don’t be impatient,
sir; many a bright undertaking has been ruined
by too much impatience. I know it isn’t pleasant
advice to anyone to be told to take things coolly,
but that’s just the advice I would give to you.
Let things slide a bit, and when the time is ripe
for action, why then you shall know all about it.”</p>

<p>“At least you will give me the colonel’s address?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say I can; the colonel is a man of business,
and you will hear of him from everyone in
the proper quarter; but it is no part of my duty
to act as a directory. You will run against him
soon enough without my aid. So, sir, or as I
should say, my lord, if you are not busy, I am,
and I must wish you good-day.”</p>

<p>With that, the official bowed and walked away.
Frank, finding that nothing was to be done,
turned also, and so the men separated.</p>

<p>In his hurry to leave England and reach the
United States, Fenella’s husband had neglected
to arm himself with letters of introduction, and
now he found the disadvantage of being in a
strange city without a friend. He walked down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Broadway, and paraded Fifth Avenue, but saw
none but unfamiliar faces. He had put up at
one of the large New York hotels, where he had
advisedly given a false name. He was not particularly
anxious to make the acquaintance of the
American interviewer, a gentleman who was
unique until copied in England some few years
ago. So far he had been able to preserve his
incognito, as the police official, who was a kind
fellow at heart, had promised to preserve the
secret of his identity. So, chafing at the delay,
he wandered about listlessly, until, to his great
delight, he received one evening a summons to
attend at the bureau.</p>

<p>“You see I have not forgotten you,” said the
official. “Now I think we can set to work. The
boy you have been looking for has left the
custody of the colonel—he is no longer in his
care.”</p>

<p>“And where is he?” asked Frank eagerly.</p>

<p>“That is a conundrum, my lord, that, for the
moment, I cannot answer,” was the reply. “The
fact is, we have made a bit of a mess of it. A
recruit—a sharp one, but still a recruit—was put
upon your business, and he seems to have
muddled it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, look you here. He was ordered to
keep his eye on the lad, and to report when the
boy was removed from the colonel’s custody.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Well, he did his duty, inasmuch as he gave us the
notice the boy was off. That has been reported
right enough, but——” he stopped.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know where my son is at this moment?”
said Frank angrily.</p>

<p>“Well, sir—I should say, my lord—that is
exactly what I cannot say. Our man rushed off
to tell us the news of departure; he would have
done better had he followed up the track.”</p>

<p>“And what do you propose to do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have made the best of it. We have
sent a first-class officer, up to every move in the
game, to take the matter up, and by this time
you may be sure the country is being scoured
high and low. When we come upon a track you
shall hear of it. We can trust the colonel. He
is respected, and would not lend himself to any
underhand piece of work. But it’s the lady that
is doing it. Now, we have not much of an opinion
about her, and she is in it, that’s the worst of
it. However, don’t you cry out yet; ours is the
smartest service in the world, and we will do our
best for you.”</p>

<p>“But can I do nothing?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, sir—I should say, my lord—I don’t
see that you can. You had better look in to-morrow
evening, and then I could report progress.
In the meanwhile, keep an eye upon yourself.
New York is a dangerous place for a stranger.
I know you Englishmen are brave fellows, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
such a thing as kidnaping, even an adult, is not
unknown on this side of the Atlantic. So have
a care, sir—I should say, my lord.”</p>

<p>Smiling at the correction, Frank departed,
determining to return on the following evening.
On his way to the hotel, he had to pass a large
house at the corner of a street, and as he walked
along, he felt that there was someone gazing at
him from one of the ground-floor windows. He
turned his head in that direction, and immediately
a blind was drawn down abruptly. But not
until two piercing eyes had gazed for a moment
into his own. He resumed his way and then
stopped suddenly. He was quite alone, for the
street was empty. He raised his hand to his
brow, and trembled as if he had an ague fit. He
seemed to be fighting some unseen, some terrible
enemy. The perspiration ran down his face, and
then of a sudden he became calmer, unnaturally
calm. He appeared to be in a trance. He
moved as if some power was controlling his
actions. He hesitated, but only for a second,
and then began to retrace his steps, and slowly
but surely he walked along, as a somnambulist
progresses. His eyes were wide open, but sightless;
his arms hung listlessly by his side, until
the time came for him to open a door, then
slowly he extended his right arm, and his rigid
hand seized the handle. He had passed through
and entered the hall. Slowly he walked up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
stairs, and slowly he made his way to the entrance
of a large room. Again he opened a door,
and again he walked on, until, seemingly exhausted,
he sank into a chair.</p>

<p>When he returned to consciousness, he still
imagined he was taking part in some strange
dream. For although he did not recognize the
apartment in which he was resting, a familiar
figure was bending over him. A woman had just
taken her hand from his brow and was standing
over him. He uttered an exclamation of horror,
and tried to rise to his feet. The woman smiled
and withdrew her hand, and once more he sank
back in the chair in which he was resting.</p>

<p>Lord Francis Onslow and Mme. de Vigny were
face to face.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br>

BY JEAN MIDDLEMASS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Love</span> was dead. There was no gainsaying the
fact. With returning consciousness the expression
of hatred became so fully developed on his
face that Lucille de Vigny cowered before it.
His wild bloodshot eyes looked as if they were
ready to start from his head, and the desperation
in his entire mien made her feel that there was no
length to which he would not venture. Was he
about to commit another murder?</p>

<p>Mme. de Vigny knew naught of the previous
one, or probably she would have run away in dire
fear.</p>

<p>As it was, she was under the impression that
the man she had once so loved and still cared for
more than anyone else in life, had suddenly
become mad.</p>

<p>Rising at last to his feet with an effort, he
began to speak gaspingly, “You fiend, you arch-demoness,
where is my child?”</p>

<p>She laughed, and calling up her courage tried
to brave the matter out, though certainly she had
never been so frightened in all her life before.
Then seeing that laughter irritated him, she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“I believe he has gone back to his mummy, or
at all events to Mrs. Grandison. Colonel Clutterbuck,
my husband, would not stand him any
longer.”</p>

<p>“It is a lie, and you know it. Colonel Clutterbuck
is not your husband, and the child has not
left America. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“As you know so much, probably you know
the rest. It is therefore useless for me to speak.”
Her tone and her manner were most aggravating,
and in Lord Francis Onslow’s then mood were
positively dangerous. After the semi-somnolent,
semi-stupid phase through which he had passed,
an excitement had set in over which he had but
little control.</p>

<p>He turned savagely on Mme. de Vigny, and
seized her by the throat with his long, thin fingers,
and yet she was the woman before whom he
had once knelt in adoration.</p>

<p>“My boy—where is my boy? Tell me, where
is Ronny?”</p>

<p>How could she tell him while he held her in a
vise, even if she wished to do so. She tried
vainly to utter some sound, possibly a scream,
but nothing was heard save a gurgle, while her
features became livid. The look of her to a
degree sobered him, and he relaxed his grip; that
is, he almost threw her from him with a force
that caused her to fall with her head against the
sharp edge of a sofa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>Even then he took no notice of her; it did not
seem to trouble him that she was hurt, or that
the handkerchief she held to her head was covered
with blood.</p>

<p>He did not, however, attempt to touch her
again, but walked up and down the room talking
rapidly:</p>

<p>“Curse of my life that you have been, give me
my child, that I may take him to the wronged
Fenella and forget that you ever existed. If it
had not been for you, what a happy man I
might have been with Fenella—my beautiful
Fenella.”</p>

<p>“And De Mürger?” asked Lucille, whose sting
even fright and injury had not wholly killed.</p>

<p>“De Mürger—curse him too—but I forgot, he
is dead—Fenella killed him to save her honor,
even as I will kill you, if you do not take me
where I shall find Ronny.”</p>

<p>But Mme. de Vigny had not quite lost her
wits, or her capacity for self-defense, though the
pain in her head was intense, and the blood was
still flowing freely. She managed, without his
remarking it, to crawl from the sofa to the door,
and then suddenly, before he had time to stop
her, she jumped up, opened it, passed rapidly
out, closed it, and locked him in.</p>

<p>Having done this, she could do no more, but
fell in a dead faint on the mat.</p>

<p>Meantime, “cabined, cribbed, confined,” Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Francis was indeed “kept like a tiger in too small
a cage.”</p>

<p>She had thought him mad, and in truth it
almost seemed as if she were right. He thumped
at the door till the echoes in the house rang
again, still no one came; the servants were all
very far away, and were, moreover, amusing
themselves with a game of poker, which was
engrossing them far more at that moment than
their mistress’s visitors and quarrels. Not successful
with the door, Lord Francis tried the
window, but it was at least sixty feet from the
ground—the jump was certain death—then he
fell to smashing sundry bits of bric-a-brac that
fell in his way—more to annoy Lucille than
because he did not know what he was doing; and
finally he rang the bell.</p>

<p>The bell brought Lucille’s maid, but she did
not open the door, though he loudly demanded
that it should be unlocked.</p>

<p>The maid found her mistress faint and bleeding
on the landing; it was scarcely likely she would
open the door till she had tended her, especially
as there was no cessation of the smashing inside.</p>

<p>Lucille was recovering her senses when the
maid arrived, and thus by the help of an arm
crawled into her own room, which was not very
far distant. The first sentence she managed to
pronounce was:</p>

<p>“Do not let him out, he is mad. Poor man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
he has a dreadful wife who has driven him mad.
Set someone to watch the door in case he should
force it, and send for Dr. Walton.”</p>

<p>It was not for herself that Mme. de Vigny
desired the presence of Dr. Walton, for she
washed her face, and put some plaster on the
wound, which, after all, was not a very serious
one, and she was a good deal revived by the time
the doctor arrived.</p>

<p>Dr. Walton was a personal friend of Mme. de
Vigny, that is she had made a friend of him since
she had come to New York. She had a wonderful
facility for fascinating the male sex and annexing
their services, and she felt very certain she could
depend on Dr. Walton, or she would not have
sent for him.</p>

<p>When he did arrive, which was speedily, he
was naturally aghast at the injury she had received.
She would have allowed him to see it at
its worst stage if she had not feared to disillusionize
him by the aspect she had presented when
the maid found her.</p>

<p>“Never mind me,” she said, “I shall be all right
in a day or two; but I cannot go on being subject
to attacks from that madman, you must remove
him; he says I have his child, whereas you know
Ronny is my own nephew.”</p>

<p>Dr. Walton did not know anything except
what she had told him, but he believed in her,
and therefore did not think of doubting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
statement. “My dear madame, I will do the best
I can for you; of course, this must be stopped.
Do you think it will be necessary to take—ahem—extreme
measures? I have some influence
with the police.”</p>

<p>“No police at all, if you please, Dr. Walton.
The police are a body with which I wish to have
no dealings. They have never done me any
good. You have a house a little way out of town,
where you keep patients who cannot control
themselves. Take this man there as your guest,
until I have time to communicate with his friends
in England. He will be out of mischief and
harm, and you will be doing a good action.”</p>

<p>“You know his friends?” asked Dr. Walton, a
little dubious whether he was not risking his professional
reputation by taking this step.</p>

<p>“Well, I am most intimate with his wife.
She is a most flighty, ill-behaved little person.
I fancy it is her shortcomings that have driven
this poor man to desperation. Still, of course,
she is the proper person to communicate with.
Hark, how he is knocking at that door again—there
really is no time to be lost. I do not believe
there is a bit of whole furniture in the room.”</p>

<p>Thus urged, Dr. Walton proceeded to do what
she wished; in fact, he began to think that it was
the only thing that could be done. To get this
man away quietly was, however, the difficulty—he
did not want a scene and a scandal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Can you depend on the man on guard?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“For coin—yes,” she said, laughing, “money
makes most people reliable—for a time.”</p>

<p>“Well, stay where you are, and leave me to do
the rest. I will return later, and let you know
the result.” So saying, Dr. Walton proceeded to
the room where Lord Francis was still knocking
clamorously. He said a few words in a low tone
to the man at the door, and then he proceeded to
interview the supposed lunatic.</p>

<p>To anyone less experienced than Dr. Walton,
Lord Francis would certainly have seemed to be
quite mad, but the doctor saw at once that he
was merely suffering from excessive nervous
excitement.</p>

<p>A few days’ seclusion would, however, he
thought, do him no harm, as by that time, with a
little judicious treatment, he would probably be
quite himself again.</p>

<p>Was there something in Dr. Walton’s touch or
look that soothed Lord Francis, predisposed as
he was to hypnotic influence, or was the doctor
armed with some calming anæsthetic—who shall
say? But, as if by magic, rage and excitement
subsided, and as though insensible to what was
passing around, Lord Francis sank down once
more into the chair in which he was sitting when
he first saw Lucille de Vigny.</p>

<p>Now he was entirely in the doctor’s power, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
could do with him as he liked. The servant still
outside the door was called into the room, and in
less than five minutes Frank Onslow was transported
to the doctor’s carriage, and was driven off
to the private madhouse outside the city, of
which Dr. Walton was the director.</p>

<p>From her bedroom window, by the aid of a gas
lamp in the street, Lucille de Vigny saw him
depart.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said, “you are mine, to do as I like
with. You will not leave that place until you
have absolutely given up Fenella—forever.”</p>

<p>Mme. de Vigny was an attractive woman, and
she had, as in the instance of Dr. Walton, her
slaves. She forgot that Fenella was quite as
attractive, nay, more so, for she was younger than
Lucille, and many thought her much better looking.
She, too, had her devoted allies; Clitheroe
Jacynth was no mean opponent for Walton, save
that Walton was on his own ground. Still, if
Mme. de Vigny was not very much on the alert
she might yet be balked.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, she decidedly held
the trump cards in this terrible life game.</p>

<p>For some minutes after the carriage had driven
off she stood by the window, thinking. The day
had been an eventful one, and before the morrow
dawned she must decide on some plan of action.
A move out of her present quarters was inevitable,
unless she wished to be turned out. Besides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
since she no longer dared call herself Mrs.
Clutterbuck, it was far better to reappear as
Mme. de Vigny in a new place. She did not,
however, wish to leave the city till circumstances
had shaped themselves somewhat; but New York
was large enough for her to remain <i>perdu</i> for
awhile if necessary. She counted her dollars.
Colonel Clutterbuck’s parting gift had been no
mean one. She would not want money for some
time to come. Having so far arranged her affairs,
and told the maid to pack up, as they were going
away for a few days, she went into the sitting
room where Frank Onslow had been locked in for
at least an hour, and, as she surveyed the <i>débris</i>,
she smiled.</p>

<p>When Clutterbuck came back, as he doubtless
would in a few days, when he thought she had
had time to clear out, what would be his feelings!
as, of course, he would attribute the breakages to
her and call it petty revenge; but what matter,
in fact she felt rather glad that it had happened,
especially as, casting her eyes round the room,
she saw that the desk was uninjured. If Lord
Francis had managed to dive into that, there
is no saying what a pregnant change there
might not have been effected in the course of
events.</p>

<p>She opened it, took from it the papers which
she considered of considerable importance to herself,
sealed them up in some strong brown paper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
and put the packet carefully into a dispatch box
she intended to take with her.</p>

<p>For that night she would sleep under Colonel
Clutterbuck’s roof, and on the morrow she would
take her departure. Before, however, she went
to bed, there was still work to be done. She told
the servants, who did not yet know of the separation,
that their master would not be in and that
they could shut up the house and go to bed.
Having thus rid herself of them, she got ready
to go out, tying a very thick veil over her hat in
order to conceal the white plaster on her head,
which might otherwise have been remarked. The
servants’ quarters were at the back of the house,
so she slipped out unobserved. She took a car
and went to an outlying part of the city. There
she got out and walked down two or three streets,
looking carefully behind her to see if she were
followed.</p>

<p>At last she knocked at the door of a tumble-down-looking
house. It was opened by a slatternly
foreigner, whose face lighted up into
something like a smile when she saw Mme. de
Vigny. Not that she had any love for her, but
her coming meant gold, and it was of the avaricious
nature of this woman to do anything for
money. “Is it all right?” asked Lucille, speaking
French in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, he went this morning, and if Satan himself
sent his myrmidons on the quest, they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
not find him. Poor boy, it will be a hardish life
that he will lead in the future. Have you ever
read Daudet’s ‘Jack’?”</p>

<p>“Tush for Daudet’s ‘Jack!’ Don’t mix up sentiment
with business.”</p>

<p>“Business is done for the present, as far as I
am concerned, only I quite understand I have to
mother him in the future—mercy, what a lot of
money it does cost to keep a child, even in a poor
way.”</p>

<p>“I know all about it, the terms are arranged.
Here is six months’ money in advance, as I am
going away for a little. Not the slightest deviation
in our compact, remember. You are in my
hands, I know your past.”</p>

<p>The woman made a cringing movement as she
pocketed the money, and gave a promise of
allegiance, but a few minutes later, as Mme. de
Vigny walked away, she muttered to herself:</p>

<p>“I know as much of you as you of me, <i>ma belle</i>
Lucille. Which of us has the most need to be
afraid of the past, I wonder?”</p>

<p>Mme. de Vigny adopted the same plan for
returning home that she had done for coming
to these purlieus. She took a car to Broadway,
and from there started to walk to Colonel
Clutterbuck’s house.</p>

<p>She had not, however, proceeded far, when, to
her consternation and surprise, she met Lord
Castleton and Clitheroe Jacynth strolling together
arm-in-arm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all forms of mental torture to which a sane
human being can be subjected, say which is the
worst? To hear the door of your prison cell
close behind you, with hope gone, friends alienated,
love ruined, home wrecked, and the awful
prospect of seven years’ unutterable silence and
solitude, knowing before God you are an innocent
man? Or to discover, and beat your brains into
discord with the knowledge, that being sane, you
are the inmate of a lunatic asylum; that, having
reason, you are classed with idiots; and that
every explanation you can offer will be treated
with a mocking laugh?</p>

<p>The borderland between sanity and insanity is
slighter than many believe or would care to own.
If ever man’s brain had been tested to its utmost
limits of tension, that brain beat and throbbed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the head of the wretched Frank Onslow. He
had lost his adored wife and had found her; he
had been granted the supreme hour of reconciliation
and rapture, and it was turned into the dull
agony of expected death. He had been told
that if she awakened from her dull brain stupor,
and could mingle her kisses with those of her
husband and her child, her life might be spared,
and he knew that when she did awake and discovered
that her lover and her lord had vanished
without a word, she might be dead even now.
He might have killed her. He who would have
died to give her life, might, for aught he knew,
have struck her once more, just as she was tottering
into the very arms of death. Everything had
failed; utterly, completely failed. Frank Onslow
had become gray with grief.</p>

<p>The child who should have been in his arms
was lost, God knows where. The wife whose life
depended upon his honor was either dying or
dead. The woman who had by him been
changed from a companion into a fiend was triumphant.
And he, the hapless victim, was under
lock and key, powerless to move, impotent for
good or evil.</p>

<p>The more the poor creature protested his sanity
the more mad he seemed to be. The very
situation, the ghastly surroundings, the hideous
objects he met on every side, were enough to
turn the brain of the strongest man. Insanity is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
bred in the air like a pestilence. Mad doctors
become mad. Nurses, attendants, porters, and
servants connected with lunatic asylums in time
are devoid of reason. Put a madhouse, private
or public, in any given neighborhood, and in the
course of years the surrounding villages and
neighbors will become as cracked as <i>King Lear</i>
himself, as suicidal as <i>Ophelia</i>.</p>

<p>When Frank Onslow awoke from the stupor of
surprise, he found to his horror that he was surrounded
by gibbering madmen and crack-brained
women. They sneaked round him, pulled him
by the sleeve, and babbled nonsense into his ears.
They believed that everyone was mad but themselves.
They were deceitful, cruel, treacherous,
hysterical, and maudlin.</p>

<p>Here was an old man driven mad by gluttony,
a wild weird, wolf-like man, who, after every meal,
chattered for the next like a monkey. Scarcely
had he swallowed his dinner before he stamped
up and down the corridor muttering, “I want my
nice tea and cut bread and butter. I tell you I
want my nice tea and brown bread and butter.”
And after tea was swallowed he whined for his
supper. Here was the young lover who was
driven mad because he could not marry the girl
he had met night after night in the stalls of the
opera. Every night he dressed himself up in his
evening clothes, put an artificial flower in his
button-hole, and sitting on an old wooden chair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
looked into space and warbled the music of <i>Faust</i>’s
love scene. Here was a woman driven mad by
the bad man who had deserted her, whose hair
had turned gray in her long imprisonment, but
who ever since wept tears all day over the love
letters thrust into her bosom and reduced to a
pulp with much weeping. Here was the man
who believed he had a millstone on his head;
here the woman who was convinced that every
means was being taken to accomplish her dishonor;
out they all came, mumbling, maundering,
making faces at one another, pulling and
picking at one another’s coat sleeves, defiant,
blasphemous, hysterical, howling, and weeping,
men and women cursing, men and women rending
the air with their piteous cries. Men glared
at him with features distorted with rage, women
hissed at him with lips polluted with blasphemies.
It was enough to make anyone mad to
talk to them. This was no home for the afflicted.
It was a veritable hell upon earth.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that there was no humane
desire to cure the insane. In public institutions
they attempt to cure, too often in private homes
they do not hesitate to kill the last vestige of
reason. The doctors, instead of soothing their
patients, irritated them. The mad point was not
avoided, it was insisted upon. The consequence
was that the wards, comparatively quiet before
the medical attendants went their rounds, became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
a pandemonium after they left them. It would
never have done to cure a paying patient. The
object was to make him day by day madder and
madder still.</p>

<p>In order to save his distracted brain, Frank
Onslow relapsed into solemn and sullen silence.
He was tortured with their mocking laughs. If
he appealed to the doctors they laughed at him;
if he consulted the attendants they turned away
with a grin. If he hoped to obtain sympathy
from the patients, the fitful gleam of intelligence
turned into the animal laughter that was hideous.</p>

<p>“I shall go mad,” said the wretched man to
himself, “unless I hold my peace. Henceforward
I will be dumb. It is my only safety.”</p>

<p>There were regular visiting days at this particular
establishment. The proprietor of it did not
dare to run counter to public opinion, and he was
artful enough to encourage these visits of inspection
in order to show how admirable and infallible
was his system. The patients were driven mad
in private, and petted in public. They were literally
fawned upon and thrashed.</p>

<p>Frank Onslow was saved by a miracle. In his
darkest hour of distress he had lost hope in everything
but prayer for help, prayer for deliverance,
prayer that he might be rescued in order to protect
the helpless. He was sitting moodily in his
room, tortured with the sense that his reason
would soon be lost to him, when he remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
that this was the day when visitors were admitted.
He had prayed until his brow dripped
with agony. His experience of the curious visitors
so far had not been very encouraging.
Whenever he attempted to get into conversation
with any of them, or to pass a letter into their
hands, he was greeted with a smile, or one of
those mocking laughs. “Poor fellow,” they
whispered, “how dreadfully mad he is.” If not,
they shrank from him as if he had been a wild
beast.</p>

<p>The great iron bell pealed at the asylum gates.
There were voices in the hall. Frank Onslow
listened and listened again. It was an English
voice talking to an American. Where had he
heard that voice before? They were coming
upstairs. The voices, indistinct before, became
louder and louder. Yes; he knew both their
voices. They were perfectly familiar to him.</p>

<p>“My God, is it possible? Can it be true? Are
my unworthy prayers answered at last?”</p>

<p>The door of the room opened, and before the
imprisoned man stood Lord Castleton and the
very American detective who had been consulted
when Frank arrived from England.</p>

<p>Here was an unexpected discovery. It was a
miracle of miracles. There had been no search
for the missing man. There was no hue and cry.
Lord Castleton, like most Englishmen of an
inquiring turn of mind, wanted to see the sights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
of New York, in order to record his impressions
when he returned home. He had employed the
services of one of the sharpest detectives in the
city to show him round, and by a miracle he had
discovered and probably saved the life and reason
of his old friend.</p>

<p>In an instant the officer of police understood
and grasped the situation. Once given the clew,
and difficulties melt into thin air. It took very
little time to procure an order for the release of
the unfortunate Englishman, and before night-time
the medical proprietor of the fashionable
madhouse was safely lodged in a New York prison,
and available for evidence on the subject of Mrs.
Senator Clutterbuck, and, more important still,
the safety and whereabouts of the unfortunate
child Ronny.</p>

<p>At one time it appeared as if the troubles of
Frank Onslow would end in an unsuspected manner.
The drama was becoming a tragedy. He
was released, it is true; he was safe once more.
The discovery of his child was now more than
probable. The discomfiture of his enemy, Mrs.
Clutterbuck, was nearly complete, but the reaction
after all this mental and physical strain nearly cost
Frank Onslow his life. The strongest men break
down at a given point, and now it was Frank’s
turn to succumb.</p>

<p>Once outside the asylum he appeared to be
more insane than when he was in it. He wanted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
to face his enemy, and swore he would kill her.
He pleaded to scour New York for the boy. He
rushed off to the telegraph office to inform the
wretched mother that he was true, and she might
yet hope, but the strain was too much for even
his strong constitution, and when he had placed
in the hands of the detective every atom of
information he possessed, and had almost imperatively
been urged to leave the work of discovery
to the hands of others, he went back reluctantly
to his hotel, half-hysterical with excitement,
but utterly dead beat. Lord Castleton
found his friend, next morning, raging in the
delirium of fever. At one time he cried piteously
for Fenella, and kissed the pillow where he
believed she had rested; in another instant he
was twisting the bedclothes into a knot and imagined
he was strangling Mme. de Vigny. In the
intervals he was sobbing, as if his heart would
break, “Ronny, Ronny, my boy, my boy!”</p>

<p>No woman could have tended a sick man with
greater devotion than did Lord Castleton. Night
and day he never left his friend except to receive
reports from the head office of the detectives,
who once more proved themselves the finest
officers in connection with any police service in
the world. By constant care and devoted nursing
the crisis was past. Reluctantly the doctors
gave the permission for a move to be made, and
on a certain bright morning Lord Castleton, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
the aid of an invalid carriage, took his worn and
wasted friend down to the docks, where he had
secured berths for England on board one of the
fastest steamers of a prominent line. The journey
to the sea seemed to revive the patient. As
yet he had not been allowed to see any friends
save Castleton, or to ask any questions. But the
mists gradually disappeared from his eyes, and a
smile of happiness played on his wan features.</p>

<p>“God bless you, old boy,” he said to Castleton
as they drove slowly to the ship. “God reward
you. Never did man find a truer friend. I
should have been under the turf, old man, if it
had not been for your tender care.”</p>

<p>Castleton was anxious not to excite his friend
too much. For the day was not over, and he
knew that the drama of it was not yet complete.</p>

<p>On board they found Jacynth, who had been
as loyal to his trust as Castleton.</p>

<p>The two men, when they met, whispered for a
second to one another, and there was a look of
distressed suspense on Frank Onslow’s face.</p>

<p>“Is all well?” whispered Castleton.</p>

<p>“More than well,” answered Jacynth.</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“In the cabin.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we dare risk it?”</p>

<p>“We must and shall,” muttered Lord Castleton.
“He can’t break down now. It may save
his life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>Gently these two brave gentlemen led their
poor sick friend to his cabin, placed him on his
couch, but before they left him in a half-dream
they uncovered the sleeping form of a little child
who was resting in an opposite berth, the fingers
of one hand twisted in his sunny locks and the
others clasped over a woman’s portrait. The
faithful Jacynth had taken it from next his heart
and placed it in the child’s hands.</p>

<p>It was Ronny, who had gone to sleep kissing
his mother’s picture, which had fallen from his
baby hands.</p>

<p>For hours the sick man slept, and his friends
stood, sentinel-like, loyal hearts at the cabin door.
The sun had sunk, the stars were out, and the
steamer was already miles at sea, plowing through
the waves, lessening the journey between America
and dear old England.</p>

<p>Still the true friends watched at the sick man’s
door.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a passionate cry, a wild
cry of pleasurable pain, a cry that faded into a
moan of relief.</p>

<p>“Ronny, Ronny darling—my child, my son—oh!
how good is God. Let us thank God together.”</p>

<p>Quietly the two friends opened the cabin door
and saw father and son on their knees in an
attitude of prayer. The child was looking up
into his father’s eyes, and the wasted man with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
streaming eyes was kissing his wife’s portrait,
and murmuring, “I have kept my oath. Beloved
one, I’m bringing Ronny home to his mother’s
arms.”</p>

<p>The stars went out and darkness fell upon the
sea. There was silence in the cabin now, for
father and boy were wrapped in a profound sleep.
Castleton and Jacynth had finished their cigars
and turned in.</p>

<p>Close upon midnight two figures came upon
deck from the steerage part of the steamer, and
walked backward and forward without exchanging
a single word. But they never separated.</p>

<p>It was a detective from Scotland Yard, and
Mme. de Vigny was in his custody, cursing her
fate.</p>

<p>As the huge ship plunged through the green
Atlantic waves, bearing homeward the fatal lives
of so many interested in this eventful history,
poor Fenella, worn almost to a shadow, sat
dreaming in her garden in “the island of carnations.”</p>

<p>She knew, at any rate, that Frank was faithful,
and that her boy was safe.</p>

BY CLO. GRAVES.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great liner swiftly pushed her homeward
way through the rolling surges of the Atlantic.
Other yearning, tender hearts there doubtless
were whose sole freight of hope the steamer carried;
but the heart that beat so anxiously in the
little Guernsey cottage had the most at stake.
The ordeal of the past months had not lessened
Fenella’s beauty. The outlines of her features
were sharper, their tints less vivid than of old.
The tawny eyes looked wistfully out upon the
world from orbits that were hollowed with grief
and watching, the chestnut hair showed a thread
of silver here and there. Would Ronny know
his mother again? Fenella often asked herself
that question. Meanwhile, for the child’s sake,
she husbanded her newly-recovered strength with
jealous care. She ate and drank, rose and slept,
walked and rested, for Ronny. He must not
find a peevish invalid in place of the old playfellow.
None but her own hands should henceforth
minister to the needs of this small idol of
her heart. With these and other fond foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
fancies, she wore away the tedious hours of
waiting.</p>

<p>One of her usual walks led in the direction of
the village of St. Sampson’s. The brown-faced
quarrymen and fisher-folk grew accustomed to
the sight of the pale, plainly-dressed lady with
the wistful eyes, who so often paused to rest, or
to smile at and speak kindly to the sturdy, sun-burnt
urchins that rolled in the dust by cottage
thresholds, and pulled off their blue knitted caps
as they passed her, in rude homage of her beauty,
and respect for her loneliness.</p>

<p>One bright October afternoon she sat upon one
of the rough wooden benches facing the wall of
the little harbor, watching the progress of a
child’s game. There were five players, four of
them hard-fisted, mop-headed urchins, with the
brown skins and blue eyes that seem indigenous
to the island. The fourth was a girl of nine or
ten, a pale-faced, black-haired little creature, with
a shrewd, selfish manner and a voice of unchildish
shrillness. The game had to do with a wedding,
of course—all the Guernsey children’s games deal
with marriages or christenings—and the song
that accompanied it was vocalized with immense
vigor and zest by all the performers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Jean, gros Jean, marryit sa fille,</div>
<div class="verse">Grosse et grasse et bie habille.</div>
<div class="verse">A un marchand d’sabots;</div>
<div class="verse">Radinguette, Radin got!</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>The verse was repeated with even more shrillness.
Then the marriage procession tailed away
round the corner with a clattering of little wooden
shoes, the sallow-faced girl gallantly supported on
the tattered jacket-sleeve of the most bullet-headed
of the boys. Fenella laughed, not with
the ringing, careless music of the old days, but
still sweetly and clearly. She lifted her eyes and
met the melancholy glance of a shabby man, a
stranger whose attention, like her own, had been
attracted by the children.</p>

<p>The man was poorly dressed. He wore an old
greatcoat of gray frieze, and a peaked cap shadowed
a lean, unshaven, sallow face. The fringes
of his ragged trousers fell over broken boots.
No scarecrow was ever more dingily attired than
this strange man, who now lifted his cap and
bowed with something of foreign ceremoniousness,
and looked at Fenella out of melancholy,
hollow eyes.</p>

<p>“When the heart is heavy, madame, it is good
to look at the little people.” He spoke in English
fluently, and with a strong French accent.
“They are so gay always. They know so little of
care. To sing and shout, and jump Gros Jean,
that is the business of life. Well! As good a
business as any other when all is said and
done.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and folded his arms
upon his hollow chest, shivering as the keen sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
breeze crept in at the loopholes of his raggedness,
and nipped his gaunt body. He did not beg, or
seem about to. The impulse was self-prompted
that stretched Fenella’s hand to him with a silver
coin in it.</p>

<p>“Take this. You look ill or hungry.”</p>

<p>“Hungry, madame,” said the man softly. “A
thousand thanks.” He hid the coin about him
furtively, and saluted Lady Onslow again. The
lifted cap revealed a narrow head shaved almost
to the skin. Upon the temples was a livid scar,
new-healed and ugly.</p>

<p>“You are a stranger to Guernsey?” Fenella
hazarded.</p>

<p>“A stranger, madame. I came from Cherbourg
yesterday. A fisherman brought me in his boat.
I am not particular as to my accommodation, as
madame will guess, nor was the boatman extortionate.
Yet he took all my money, and left me
without enough to buy a meal.”</p>

<p>“You have friends in the island?”</p>

<p>“No and yes,” the man returned. “The little
daughter of one who was an old comrade of mine
lives here in charge of a woman who was her
foster-mother, and has married a foreman of the
stone works. Madame has seen her playing with
the children of the good <i>carrier</i>. She did not
know who looked at her and questioned of her
name just now. When last I saw her (five years
ago), she was but four years old. At four years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
old the little Lucille could not be expected to
understand—madame is cold?”</p>

<p>Fenella shrunk and shivered at the sound of
that hated name. She recovered herself in another
instant. She looked at the forlorn creature,
who tried to interest her in his little story,
with compassionate gentleness.</p>

<p>“Can the father not come himself to see his
child?” she asked. “Is he an invalid or——?”</p>

<p>The man answered her shortly and harshly.</p>

<p>“The father is in prison.”</p>

<p>He laughed a grating laugh, and ground the
heel of his broken boot upon the pavement.</p>

<p>“Has madame patience to hear his story?
Common enough, common enough. The father
of the little black-haired one was once a clerk in
a bank at Lille. He had assured prospects,
enough for present wants; a charming—oh! yes,
a charming wife—and a child. Charming women
are apt to be vain; vain ones are apt to be extravagant,
madame. She wanted money—always
money. Her husband was like wax in her hands.
<i>Hein!</i> She molded her wax well—so well. She
made of an honest man a rogue, madame, a
forger, and a thief.”</p>

<p>He broke off to wipe away the leaden drops that
had gathered on his face, with a miserable rag of a
tattered handkerchief. His gaunt figure quivered,
and the sinews started out like cords on the
backs of his wasted hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>Fenella spoke to him gently. “It distresses
you to speak of it,” she said.</p>

<p>“It relieves me to speak of it. Figure to yourself,
madame, how this man must have loved that
wretch to sin so at her bidding. And she—she
had not even the merit of being faithful to
him. He found that out before the trial—for
the frauds were discovered, and he was arrested.
He denounced her as his accomplice. She
fled before the law could lay hands on her—with
one who had been, for long, her secret
lover.”</p>

<p>His face was frightful as he said the words. If
he had been himself the wretched dupe, whose
dreadful story he had upon his lips, he could not
have looked and spoken with greater rancor.
But he went on:</p>

<p>“So my friend—always my friend, madame will
remember—is found guilty and sentenced to
imprisonment for eight years. He is sent to the
‘Maison Centrale’ at Clairvaux. Compulsory
labor, absolute silence; silence in the dormitory,
silence in the workshop, silence in the yard,
silence in bed, from half-past six until six the
next morning is the Clairvaux routine. Madame
would never imagine how many cries of execration
and despair, how many sobs of anguish, how
many oaths of vengeance can be packed into the
space of one human breast, that has the padlock
of the Law upon it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>He struck his own breast as he spoke fiercely,
and shook his clenched hand in the air.</p>

<p>“I have been a prisoner myself,” he went on;
“madame is not afraid of me? I knew that man
at Clairvaux. Prisoners have methods of communication
in spite of rules and punishments. I
knew his sorrow as he my own. I promised him,
when my hour of liberation came, I would visit
the island to which his child had been taken, see
her without speaking to her, and send him word.
The last two years of his sentence have yet to
expire before my friend can speak, unless he
grows desperate, as a man does when the end is
near, and escapes from prison. Clairvaux is a
strong place, but there is a way out of it. He
has told me so. Chut! Here are the little ones
returning. You are going, madame? Accept my
thanks, the gratitude of a poor man whom you
have helped upon his way. I have not wearied
you with the story of my friend? A common
criminal, no more. And once having been in
prison, as philanthropic people say, it is twenty
to one that he will eventually return there. I
myself also; but the next crime of which that
man is found guilty will not be forgery.”</p>

<p>Fenella yielded to an uncontrollable impulse.
She looked full into the hollow, glistening eyes.
She put a question to the ragged creature.</p>

<p>“Not forgery?” she said, repeating his words.
“What then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>The man bent toward her. She recoiled from
the contact of his foul and ragged garments.
She shuddered as his hot breath scorched her
cheek. In a single word he gave the answer to
her question:</p>

<p>“Murder!”</p>

<p>A dizziness came over her; she reeled, and put
out her hands to save herself from falling. They
touched the cold stone of the harbor wall. Her
drooping lids lifted, she looked round vacantly.
The man was gone.</p>

<p>“The dreadful word!” she whispered—“oh, the
cruel word! It blights the present, it blackens
the future. What can the future hold for Frank—or
for me? What does it promise to our child?
A stained title, a heritage of guilt and shame—a
heavy, heavy weight for my innocent love to
bear. Oh, my heart! My heart is breaking!”</p>

<p>Tears came to her relief. She pulled down her
veil hastily, and hurried home, as the dusk October
evening closed in. Late that night she knelt
by the open window of her bedroom, and looked
out upon the stormy heavens, upon the quiet sea.
Herm loomed near the horizon, a dark and shapeless
mass upon the sleeping ocean. The restless
eye of the lightship opened and shut; a bat
flittered noiselessly past, and vanished in the
velvet darkness.</p>

<p>“Three days more,” Fenella said, “only three
days. Oh, my son, my little son! Does the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
time seem as long to you as it does to your
mother?”</p>

<p>She closed the window and went to her bed.
Sleep would not come at first. But toward the
time of the flood tide she slept and dreamed.
She dreamed that she saw a great ship—an ocean
steamer—plowing homeward through a waste of
waters. She knew that the vessel carried those
three lives that were so dear to her. Friend,
husband, child lay sleeping in the cabins, lulled
by the throbbing of the incessant screw. All
peace, all security apparently. And yet a voice
kept whispering in her ear, “Watch, watch!
Danger!”</p>

<p>It seemed to the dreaming woman then that
she stood upon the vessel’s quiet deck. Not a
sound broke the quiet except that throbbing of
the screw. Not a sign of life appeared, until
from the dark companion-hatch of the steerage
deckhouse a solitary figure crept—the figure of a
woman. And the white face it turned upon her,
illumined by the pale rays of the moon, was the
face of Mme. de Vigny.</p>

<p>And the voice kept whispering, “Watch, watch!
Danger!” She strove to shriek aloud and warn
those on board, but her lips were sealed. She
followed the creeping figure aft. Followed it
down a narrow brass-bound stairway, with no
conscious movement of her feet. Followed it
through dusky passages, lighted by dim, swinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
lanterns, and down stairways narrower still.
Then it came to a halt and she stood behind it,
listening and watching.</p>

<p>A faint rasping sound. The striking of a
match. A flickering light that revealed the place
in which they stood together to be a place used
for the keeping of ship’s stores. Oil and tallow,
firewood and candles, coils of dry rope, bundles
of matches and other inflammable articles were
gathered there. And then she knew, as another
match struck and fired, and the pale blue flame
lighted that evil face, the deadly purpose of her
enemy. And even as she strove to burst the
bonds of silence that held her, darkness fell upon
the scene.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes, still dreaming, the
stately vessel was still gliding through the waters,
herself removed from it by a distance that seemed
impassable. But still the throbbing of the
screw mingled with the whisper that warned
her of danger to come. She strained her eyes
and held her breath, and watched as she was
bidden.</p>

<p>Then a little smoke began to curl upward from
one of the aft hatchways. Thin and white, a
narrow column of vapor slanting in the freshening
breeze. Then a forked tongue of yellow
flame shot out menacingly. And then a great
bell began to clang furiously. And mingled with
other sounds came the sound of voices shouting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
together. Only one word they kept repeating,
and that word “Fire.”</p>

<p>Fire! fire! fire!</p>

<p>The darkness was banished now by the fierce
red glare that came from the burning vessel.
Her deck was alive with orderly gangs of men
who came and went with hose and buckets, pouring
water down the hatchways upon the roaring
flames. Forward the passengers crowded together.
And among those white faces which the
quiet stars shone down upon, and the leaping
flames illuminated with their own fierce glare, the
dreaming woman saw the face of her child.</p>

<p>He was held, not in his father’s arms, but in
those of Jacynth. Frank was standing with his
hand upon the shoulder of that true friend and
stanch companion. The men spoke together
with stern, grave looks; the child laughed and
clapped his hands as the hissing tons of sea water
fought with the fire that gnawed at the vitals of
the brave vessel, deep below the water-line. And
as the mother stretched her arms toward her boy
the whole picture faded for the second time.</p>

<p>Another followed. Still the wide gray sea.
No burning vessel on it now. Only a line of
boats upon the waters, black against the background
of a lurid, stormy dawn. The boats advanced
toward the dreamer slowly. In the first
only one familiar face—the face of Lord Castleton.
In the second, none but strangers. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
third, strangers again. In the fourth and last, a
woman bound with cords lying at the bottom of
the boat amidships, a grave, stern man keeping
close watch and ward over the prisoner. In the
stern-sheets, rough-handed, pitying men, disheveled,
compassionate women, gathered round a
little group of two. One of these in the uniform
of an officer of the ship; the surgeon, perhaps,
from the skillful way in which he supported the
convulsed and trembling figure of the other on
his arm, and held a restorative to the lips and
seemed to speak vain words of comfort. And
the desolate creature, to whose misery that kindly
ministrance brought no relief, lifted his head and
looked at Fenella with eyes that were the eyes of
her husband.</p>

<p>In her sudden agony of dread it seemed to her
that she cried out the names of the two who were
missing. “Frank, where is Jacynth. Where is
Ronny? What have you done with my boy?
Tell me, for God’s sake?”</p>

<p>And it seemed that her husband heard. He
turned despairing eyes on her. He shook his
head and pointed to the sea.</p>

<p>She cried out then, and awoke as the first faint
rays of daylight pierced through the blinds of her
bedroom in the cottage at Guernsey. And the
woman who waited on her, roused by that piercing
cry, came running in.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br>

BY H. W. LUCY.<br>
<br>
<small>THROUGH FIRE AND WATER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> hours before the time Fenella beheld with
fevered fancy the light cast by the burning ship
over the illimitable waters, the <i>Danic</i>, with steam
shut down, was slowly drifting outside Cork
Harbor. She was waiting for the tender to come
alongside to take off the mails and bear away the
passengers who, having had enough of the open
sea, preferred to take the short cut by train
across Ireland and so home by Holyhead.</p>

<p>There had not chanced to be any special cause
for quitting snug quarters on board the steamer.
The <i>Danic</i> had made a splendid voyage. Not
once had the “fiddles” appeared on the dining-table
to the accompaniment of smashing crockery
in the steward’s pantry. Day after day the passengers
had been able to sit out on their deck
chairs enjoying the sunshine, the fresh breeze and
the sparkling sea, through which for hours
together the tireless dolphins swam, emulous of
the vessel’s voyant speed. Two days out they
had passed close by a whale, who cheerily spouted
farewell as they speeded by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>Ronny looked on with grave eyes. He had
often heard of a whale, but never before seen one.</p>

<p>“Will Jonah come out by and by?” he asked
Jacynth, his constant companion, who held him
standing on the rail.</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” Jacynth answered gravely.
“Jonah, you remember, did not find the quarters
so comfortable that he was likely ever to seek
them again of his own free will. Residence in a
whale, however temporary, is an experience that
satisfies an ordinary man for a lifetime. The
whale is only spouting, getting rid of superfluous
water taken in from the great depths.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ronny, his quick sympathies
moved in another direction, “he must get very
thirsty if he does that often.”</p>

<p>Ronny had thriven wondrously on the broad
Atlantic, which had in no sense proved a disappointment
to him. He was a prime favorite
with all on board, the pet of the sailors, more
particularly of the bos’n, whose whistle he was
sometimes privileged to sound. Next to Jacynth
he was fonder of the bos’n than anyone else, even
than of his father, whose mood was less attuned
to that of the light-hearted, healthy lad whom
the stewards did their best to endow with dyspepsia
by surreptitiously feeding him at unlawful
hours with spoil from the dessert. He would sit
by the hour on a coil of ropes, his big eyes fixed
intently on the brown-visaged bos’n, who told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
him stirring tales (probably not all true) of seafaring
life.</p>

<p>At first he had full run of the ship, and availed
himself of the privilege.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, running breathlessly up to
Lord Francis one morning when they were in
mid-Atlantic, “what do you think? I’ve seen
Mrs. Clutterbuck.”</p>

<p>The little fellow, who in ordinary circumstances
seemed to know no fear, trembled in
every limb, and as far as was possible with sun
and wind tanned face was pitifully pale.</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Lord Francis with a sign of
equal perturbation.</p>

<p>“Forrard,” said Ronny, who had not in vain
sat with the bos’n, and never now spoke of going
downstairs when he should say going below. “I
was standing by the rail at the end of the hurricane
deck looking at the passengers playing cards
on the steerage deck, when she came along. She
beckoned to me to go down to her, but I turned
and bolted.”</p>

<p>“Was she by herself?”</p>

<p>“No, there were a lot of people around. She
wasn’t speaking to anyone nor anyone to her.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was her?”</p>

<p>“Quite; she smiled just as she did when she
came down in the country to take me away to
join mother. I liked her smile then, but I don’t
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Ronny,” said his father, taking his hand and
leading him aft, “I want you to promise me
something; will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father,” said the boy promptly, looking
straight at him with eyes that never lied.</p>

<p>“Then you must never leave this deck for the
lower one, whether in the steerage or amidships.
It’s quite big enough for a little fellow like you.
You promise me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father,” said Ronny, and he kept his
word to something more than the letter, limiting
his excursions forward to the capstan some distance
from the steerage end. Perhaps he would
not have gone so far, but it was here his friend
the bos’n’, when his turn came, kept his watch,
and sitting there Ronny was careful to turn his
back upon the bow, so that by no chance might
he again see that evil face with the smile he,
though all unused to the world, recognized as
false.</p>

<p>On this bright evening off Queenstown Ronny
was in a condition of special glee. Jacynth had
put in the sweepstakes on the day’s run a sovereign
in the name of Ronny, and Ronny had won
the stake.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” cried Jacynth, holding him
at arm’s length, “what on earth is a little mite
like you going to do with £50?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Ronny, his eyes beaming with
delight. “I remember when we were staying at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Harrogate having a ride in a donkey chaise. It
was very nice, but mother told me that the
donkeys here are nothing like what grow in the
streets of Cairo. When she was there she had
two white donkeys as tall as a horse, with beautiful
ears as long as my arm, and great brown eyes
that look at you as if they wondered whether you
could be so cruel as to want them to trot through
dusty streets on a hot day. Mother often said
she would like to have a pair of donkeys like she
had in Cairo. ‘Pharaoh’ and ‘Rameses’ were their
names, together with a little carriage to hold her
and me. I’ll buy her the whole turnout with my
£50, and we’ll go driving about all by ourselves
through Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s pretty selfish of you,” said
Jacynth, who keenly realized the joys of the situation
as pictured by the boy, only he would liked
to have rearranged the company behind “Rameses
and Pharaoh.” They were all and always
thinking of a woman waiting and watching in
Guernsey. Lord Francis, with wistful eyes,
thought of love, Jacynth with dumb, gnawing
pain, Ronny with eager desire to see her smile,
hear her voice, and feel her arms sheltering him,
Lord Castleton having some doubt as to whether
she was worthy of it all, and Mme. de Vigny——</p>

<p>Well, Mme. de Vigny did not talk of the direction
her thoughts took.</p>

<p>It was so near the dinner hour that it had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
decided to postpone dinner till the mails and
passengers bound for Queenstown had left. The
tender was close in sight, rolling and pitching in
a manner that seemed inscrutable to the throng
leaning over the taffrail. The magnificent <i>Danic</i>
stood immovable as a stone pier on the rolling
tide. The tender was speedily freighted with
innumerable bags containing the mails, some
thirty passengers followed amid hearty farewells
from newly-made friends left behind, and many
appointments were registered to meet again in
London or Paris. With the last group there
stepped toward the gangway a tall figure, a
woman closely veiled, carrying a small bag in her
hand. Just as she was stepping on the gangway
the tender gave a lurch that dislodged the railed
plank. Two passengers already on it narrowly
escaped the disaster. They had just managed to
skip on to the paddle-box of the tender, when,
amid loud cries of “Stand back,” addressed to the
group pressing forward on to the <i>Danic</i>, half a
dozen ready hands hauled the gangway out of its
aslant position, and made things smooth again.
Once more the tall veiled figure pressed forward,
when one of the steerage passengers roughly
gripped her by the shoulder and thrust her back.
“Not this journey, madame,” he said, seizing her
wrist with a grip of iron. “Your passage is
booked all the way to Liverpool, and we may as
well make the most of the journey.” The woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
turned on her captor with the fury of a trapped
lioness. For a moment it seemed as if she
would grapple with him, and since she was nearly
his height it would have been a desperate conflict,
probably ending with a death grip under
water.</p>

<p>For a moment the idea flashed over the mind
of Mme. de Vigny. She felt her game was up;
wearied with the squalor of her unused condition,
she did not care how soon she handed in the
checks.</p>

<p>But she remembered that she had still one card
to play, over which she had brooded in the dead,
unhappy night as she lay wide awake in her narrow
berth.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better have let me go,” she
said to the man, whose plain clothes disguised his
vocation of police sergeant. Then she sauntered
slowly back, conscious that among the crowd on
the hurricane deck curiously watching this episode
was the man she really began to love with
desperate affection now that her charms no longer
lured him, and he was restlessly counting every
mile that separated him from the white-curtained,
rose-garlanded cottage in Guernsey where his
wife awaited his coming.</p>

<p>“Jacynth, I wish I was certain to live for ten
years or even for three,” said Lord Francis Onslow,
in the low, nerveless voice that had recently
become habitual to him. The two friends were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
walking up and down the deck smoking their last
cigar. Four bells had sounded and they had the
deck pretty much to themselves, save for the
ghostly figures of the watch that moved with
noiseless footsteps to and fro. When they came
on deck after dinner the moon was shining, and
far away on the starboard bow they could clearly
discern the coast of Ireland, lying like a dark
shadow on the moonlit water. Even as they
walked and talked the scene changed. It had
not at any time of the day been perfectly calm,
as the passengers on the tender found as they
made their way into Queenstown Harbor. Now
it was blowing pretty fresh from the southwest,
bringing up angry-looking clouds that from time
to time hid the moon, promising presently finally
to obscure its light. They were drawing up to
Carnsore Point, and were soon in the race of the
channel. By this time they had found their sea
legs, and though the wind played havoc with
their cigars, as they paced about, and they gave
up the attempt to keep pace in walking, they
held on, Jacynth’s spirits rising with the boisterous
breeze.</p>

<p>“Ten years, old man? Why, you’re only thirty
at most, turned middle milestone—good for another
thirty at least—and why should you not see
threescore years and ten?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Lord Francis, “I’m pretty well
played out at thirty. I’ve warmed both hands at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
the fire of life, and burnt them too. You remember
when we were in Paris, last year, going to see
Emile Angier, in the play ‘Jean de Thomeray’?
Often of late one scene comes back to me. The
silent Quai Malaquais which, on the eve of the
beleaguering of Paris, the daylight even has
deserted. Upon it <i>Jean</i> enters, skeptic and libertine,
who jeers at his friend, who has taken the
trouble to get wounded in the struggle with the
Germans closing round the capital. Suddenly
a military band approaches, playing a march
<i>Thomeray</i> knew when a child in far-off Brittany.
At sight of the Breton Mobiles marching along at
quick step to meet the enemy of the country,
<i>Thomeray’s</i> heart swells and bursts the bonds in
which his scoffing nature had permitted itself to
be bound. You remember how he steps forward
and claims a place in the Breton ranks. ‘<i>Qui êtes
vous?</i>’ they ask, looking distrustfully at his fine
gentleman’s clothes. ‘I am,’ he said, ‘a man who
has lived ill and would die well.’ That am I,
Jacynth, but it would not be meet that I should
die just yet. I’ve been a fool and worse. But if
I had only three years, two years, one year to
pay some of my long debt to Fenella, I wouldn’t
care about what might follow. It’s been all my
fault from first to last. I want time to tell her
that, and to make some slight amends.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Onslow, you are hipped; perhaps
seasick. Shall we turn in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“You might, as we shall be in the Mersey early
in the morning and there’s packing up to be done.
But I’ll take another turn. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you send me to bed, good-night. I
daresay another ten minutes in the fresh air will
take the blues out of you.”</p>

<p>For another hour Lord Francis tramped up
and down, unconscious of the unlit cigar in his
mouth, thinking of the time when he first met
Fenella, of the years of idyllic happiness that followed
their wedding day, of Ronny’s appearance
on the scene, of the little rift in the lute that,
unwatched, broadened slowly, and made all the
music of their young lives mute.</p>

<p>Softly he sang to himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Farewell, farewell,</div>
<div class="verse">A river flows between.</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Going to be a nasty night,” said a tarpaulined
figure, looming out of the murk that enveloped
the fore-part of the deck, over which the spray
drifted as the <i>Danic</i> plunged her head into the
angry sea, and lifting it again shook it as a retriever
dashes the water off its front.</p>

<p>“So it seems, bos’n,” said Lord Francis. “But
we’re not far off port now. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, my lord. Better not leave things
loose about in your stateroom to-night.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Jacynth slept the sleep of a man with a quiet
conscience and a good digestion, who had passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
the greater part of the day on deck of a ship over
which swept strong air blown across the broad
Atlantic. He rarely dreamt, but on this particular
night, some two hours after he had bidden
Lord Francis good-night, and turned into the
stateroom he had all to himself, he began tossing
about with a great weight on his mind. If he
had a weakness in the matter of personal dress it
was centered upon his stockings of rich red wool
and ribbed as is the salt sea sand. He had a
shapely leg, and missed no opportunity when out
of town of displaying it with the advantage of
knickerbocker dress. He was dreaming now that
a great calamity had befallen his treasured store
of stockings. A spark from the funnel of the
steamer, which, as he went below, he had seen
streaming fire into the dark night, had, in the
unaccountable way peculiar to dreams, fallen
upon his bundle of stockings snugly ensconced in
his box in the stateroom, and they were hopelessly
smoldering; in vain he struggled to rise,
seize a jug of water, and souse them. Something
held him down by the chest, and he could not
move. His terror seemed to have communicated
itself to the passengers and crew. Hurried feet
trampled on deck overhead. Voices sounded in
eager talk, and the bos’n’s whistle shrilly rose
above the row of the waves that thunderously
beat aft the shattered port-light. Possibly help
would come in time and some of the stockings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
would be saved. A rattle at the door. Jacynth,
almost awake, cried “Come in,” an invitation
quite superfluous, for the door was burst open.</p>

<p>“Look alive, sir!” shouted the bos’n, entering
hurriedly. “Ship’s afire, and the boats are being
got ready!”</p>

<p>“And Ronny?” said Jacynth, wide awake now
the nightmare of the burning stockings uplifted.</p>

<p>“The young un’s all right, I seed to him first,
and his father’s got him in tow. Better slew on
as many things as you can. It’ll be bad in the
boats till morning breaks.”</p>

<p>Jacynth was not long in dressing, foregoing in
his haste the luxury of his worsted stockings,
which he had full time to regret. When he went
on deck a strange sight met his eye. The passengers,
fully two hundred in number, were
massed together aft of the bridge, most of the
women bareheaded and all showing signs of hasty
dressing. From one of the hatches near the
wheel a dense volume of smoke poured forth,
now and then with increasing frequency; lit up
by tongues of flame on either side of the hatch, a
line of blue-jackets plied hose and bucket in
ineffectual struggle with the growing furnace. A
singular quietness prevailed. There was a murmur
of conversation among the closely-packed
crowd of passengers. A sharp word of command
from the first officer in charge of the fire brigade
rose from time to time above the howling wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
and the war of the turbulent waves that dashed
against the bulwarks as if possessed with passionate
desire to get at the flames. Ronny, his father
holding one hand and Lord Castleton the other,
stood on the outer fringe of the crowd aft, as near
as he could get to the fire, which he was evidently
enjoying as the best thing he had seen since the
whale disappeared. The captain and second officer
stood on the bridge, and through the wheel-house
window could be seen four grim faces of
the blue-jacketed giants whose curiously cheery
voices answered the captain’s signals with the cry
“Starboard,” “Steady it is, sir.” The captain,
leaning over the rail of the bridge and addressing
the crowd of trembling but quiet passengers, said:
“Friends below there, I hope you’re all comfortably
wrapped up. This is a bad job, but there’s
no danger. If it had come an hour later we
should have made for Holyhead and put in all
right. But with this wind and the start the fire
has got I don’t think we could carry on so far.
The land is close by. If there were daylight we
could see it. The ship is now making for the
spit of land at the back of Pwlhelly. There is a
smooth mile of beach there, which, if I can make
it, will bring the ship up comfortably, and you
can walk ashore in your slippers.”</p>

<p>Jacynth led a cheer for the gallant captain,
which was taken up by the passengers, and
seemed to do them an immense amount of good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
After this the wonderful quietness once more fell
over the doomed ship that sped onward swiftly
through the sea that was now as rough as the
bos’n’s forecast had pictured. On the crowded
deck all was as orderly as if, according to their
daily habit, the passengers had mustered to take
a look round before going down to dinner. The
wind, now blowing what even a sailor would have
admitted to be half a gale, whistled shrilly
through the creaking spars. The course taken
by the ship brought it more abaft, and sometimes
a gust blew the smoke from the burning hatch
under and across the bridge, choking the passengers
and hiding the captain and second mate
from view. But for the most part it blew clear
away over the starboard side, leaving the vessel
amidships and forward clear enough.</p>

<p>“Land ahead,” sung out the lookout man; the
sing-song voice of the man throwing the lead
showed how nearly they were approaching the
coast, the outline of which was recognized in the
deeper shadow on the horizon.</p>

<p>“Half-speed” the captain signaled to the
engine room. But the half-speed of an Atlantic
liner soon bridges space, and nearer and nearer
came the dark line of the coast. Straining
eyes looking out from beneath the bridge, could
make out the outline of a mountain, at the foot
of which nestled the smooth beach that was to
give them safety and rest. Nearer and nearer it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
came, and higher and higher rose hope. Nothing
between it and them but the sea, rough enough,
but nothing to the majestic liner, even with its
hatches full of fire. The water steadily shallowed,
as the monotonous cry of the leadsman
marked minute by minute the lessening fathoms.</p>

<p>Suddenly, even as the leadsman sang out his
last record, a crash resounded through every
fiber of the ship. The <i>Danic</i> came as suddenly
to a halt as if she had run up against Penmaenmawr.
The crowd amidships were knocked down
pell-mell over each other, as if a giant hand had
swept across them at the level of the chin. The
captain, leaning against the rail of the bridge on
the starboard side, was pitched headlong into the
sea.</p>

<p>That proved the worst thing of all. The second
officer, left in command on the bridge at this
critical moment, signaled to the engine room, “Go
astern full speed.” That seemed an order natural
enough, though the veteran Captain Irving
would not have been led into so fatal a mistake.
The <i>Danic</i> had run on to a jagged rock which
rose like a spear-head out of the sea, and had literally
embedded itself in the hull of the steamer.
Had the ship been kept head on, it might have
hung suspended, the jagged rock serving to
stanch the wound it had made, at least long
enough for the boats to be launched and everyone
to quit the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>The mighty screw, reversing its action in obedience
to the word of command, slowly but
irresistibly drew the ship back. The terrified
passengers could hear the iron plates ripped open,
and barely was the vessel free from the rock than
she began to go down by the head.</p>

<p>There was a rush for boats. They were ready
and in perfect order. But with the sea rushing in
in tons through the great gap in the hull, there
was neither time nor opportunity for the marshaling
of the now terrified passengers. It was not
generally known that the captain had gone overboard,
and the officers, expecting him to issue
instructions, hesitated. Somehow boats filled,
and four were safely launched. The two last
had not far to fall from the height of the davits,
the bulwarks being now almost level with the
water. Just as their keels touched the sea, the
great steamer went down by the head, sucking
them under.</p>

<p>As soon as the collision came, Jacynth had
darted forward to the spot where he had seen
Ronny standing, fearing no evil, for his hand was
in his father’s. When he came up to them, Lord
Castleton had disappeared—swept away, they
surmised, in the rush for the boats. Jacynth, as he
made his way aft, caught sight of Mme. de Vigny
and her escort clambering into one of the boats.</p>

<p>“Come along, Onslow, I’ll carry Ronny,” said
Jacynth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Yes, but let the women go first.”</p>

<p>“So we will; but not all the men,” said Jacynth,
grimly eying the crowd fighting round the nearest
boat.</p>

<p>“My lord and you, sir,” said the bos’n, coming
by, “take my advice. Don’t be in a hurry about
the boats. She’s settling down. In five minutes
there won’t be a bulwark above water-line, but
the masts and spars will be aloft safe and dry till
morning. Fetch young un’ along, and I’ll give
you a hand up the mainmast. There’s nothing
more I can do below. Look alive, and hold
on tight. You’ll feel a bump in another moment.”</p>

<p>With a final lurch forward the ship went down,
and the waves at last had their will on the seething
mass in the hatchway. From secure if not
comfortable quarters in the maintop Lord Francis,
Jacynth, and Ronny saw the two boatloads
swamped, heard the seething roar of the waters
as they closed over the burning hatch, and listened
with chilled hearts to the shrieks of drowning
men and women that filled the air.</p>

<p>It seemed a long night, but it was really only
three hours before, with the morning light, a
steamship bound for Liverpool, after giving a
fair start down channel to its charge, caught sight
of the wreck and took off what at first seemed to
be the only survivors.</p>

<p>“And,” said Jacynth, as he sat in the captain’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
cabin, forgetful of his own stockingless state, and
chafed Lord Onslow’s numbed hands and feet, “if
we had been four strings of priceless pearls hanging
on to the yardarm, they couldn’t have been
more delighted to have plucked us off.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.<br>

BY ADELINE SERGEANT.<br>
<br>
<small>“ALIVE OR DEAD.”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Liverpool streets were, as usual, muddy,
crowded, and malodorous; but had they been
bowers of Elysian bliss they could not be traversed
by men with gladder hearts than those of
Onslow and Jacynth when they set foot on English
soil. The gladness was of a sober sort, and
tinged, perhaps, by anxiety for the future and
sorrow for the past; but there was a natural
elation, brought about by the recollections of the
peril that they had escaped, and triumph in the
thought of Ronny’s restoration to his mother’s
arms. They took a friendly leave of the captain
and officers of the ship which had brought them
to Liverpool, and then proceeded to the nearest
hotel, where they intended to stay for a few
hours only, in order to replenish their pockets
and wardrobes.</p>

<p>“Shall we telegraph to Fenella?” Frank asked
wistfully; and Jacynth replied, in a brisker tone:</p>

<p>“Why, of course, or she will be hearing some
garbled version of the shipwreck story, and will
imagine that she has lost Ronny forever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“Don’t put too much in the telegram,” said
Lord Francis, still in an uncertain voice.
“‘Ronny safe and well; we are bringing him
back to you to-day.’ And Jacynth, old man,
sign it with both our names. She owes his
safety to you rather than to me. Sign it by
your name alone, if you like. I have no right [a
little bitterly] to claim her gratitude.”</p>

<p>Jacynth stood silent for a moment. Onslow
was generous, but did he not, after all, speak
truth? Surely he—Jacynth—had some right to
Fenella’s gratitude; it was all that would be left
to him when the husband and wife were reconciled.
He felt sure that that reconciliation would
take place, and no place would then be left for
him save that of a useful friend. Yes, he was
tempted for a moment to claim the whole of
Fenella’s gratitude for the safety of her boy.
But how could he let Frank Onslow be more
generous than himself?</p>

<p>He laughed slightly when that little pause was
ended, and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Lady Francis will question me pretty closely,
and will soon find out where credit is due,” he
said. “There is no question as to which of us
has suffered most in her cause and Ronny’s.”
And he signed the telegram with Onslow’s name
alone.</p>

<p>They had thought of going south that evening,
but an unexpected delay arose. Ronny developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
symptoms of a severe cold, verging on
bronchitis, and the doctor, who was immediately
summoned, declared that it would be the height
of folly to let him travel for a day or two. “It’s
nothing serious, but you cannot be too careful
where children are concerned,” he said, “and the
boy has had a chill. You, too [glancing at
Lord Francis] don’t look quite fit for a long
journey.”</p>

<p>“I am fit for anything; all I want is to be with
my wife again,” Onslow averred feverishly.</p>

<p>The doctor glanced at him in a dubious way
and shook his head. He knew something of the
Onslows’ history—as who did not—and did not
understand the young man’s anxiety to seek out
his presumably erring wife. “Even for yourself
I should not recommend the journey until you
have had a rest,” he said, “and as your little boy
is so unwell, you cannot do better than keep
yourselves quiet and warm, for a day or two, until
he is recovered.”</p>

<p>He spoke privately to Jacynth afterward.</p>

<p>“The little fellow is not seriously ill; you need
not be alarmed,” he said. “I am making a trifle
worse of his case than I need in order to detain
Lord Francis for a short time. I suppose you see
for yourself how much he is in need of rest and
care. The fire must have given him a severe
nervous shock.”</p>

<p>“He is not strong, but I hoped that he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
be better if I could get him to Guernsey and
leave him in good hands.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean his wife’s hands?” the doctor
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“I do. He will never be happy till he has
seen her.”</p>

<p>“Then why not telegraph to her to come here?
The great thing just now with Lord Francis is to
keep his mind easy. If her presence would
soothe and calm him you had better send for her
at once, especially as the boy is unwell. If he
should be unduly excited or agitated, however, I
would not answer for the consequences.”</p>

<p>Jacynth hesitated, “I do not know,” he said
slowly, “whether she could travel so far. She
has been ill—and——”</p>

<p>“And, perhaps—she may not care to come,
eh?” said the shrewd old doctor. “You must
excuse me if she is a friend of yours, but the fact
is, everything I have heard of Lady Francis Onslow
leads me to conclude that she will not put
herself much out of her way for her husband’s
sake.”</p>

<p>“You do not know her,” said Jacynth warmly;
then, controlling with some difficulty a feeling of
offense, he added, “I believe that she is very
much attached to Lord Francis, and would come
at once if she thought that he was ill.”</p>

<p>“Then telegraph,” said the doctor. “Anything
rather than let him travel in his present state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
nerves and heart. It might be the death of him.”
And with a brusque nod he took himself off,
leaving Jacynth more than ever perplexed by the
duty that devolved on him.</p>

<p>What could he say to Fenella that would
neither frighten nor repel? If he told her that
Ronny was ill, she would be frantic with alarm. If
he said that Lord Francis needed her, she might
shrink away with wounded pride. He thought
of the way in which she had spoken to him of her
husband, and decided that he could not hope to
conjure by his name. As he had said to the doctor,
she would come if he told her that Lord
Francis were ill; but if he summoned her on that
account, how explain her appearance to Onslow
himself? Every way seemed to be surrounded
by difficulties. At last, in desperation, he wrote
and dispatched the following telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ronny knocked up by traveling; Lord Francis also unwell;
can you come to us in order to save delay?</p>
</div>

<p>“The mother’s heart in her,” said Jacynth to
himself, “will supply all that is ambiguous in this
message, and we shall have her with us to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He felt so much more at ease when the message
was sent off, that he turned into the smoking
room to glance at the papers and smoke a cigar
before going back to Onslow. Ronny was under
the care of a nurse, and Onslow was probably
resting; he had no special responsibility with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
respect to either of them at present, and he was
glad to feel himself free.</p>

<p>The papers already contained long accounts of
the fire, of the swamping of the boats, and of the
rescue of the four survivors found clinging to the
wreck. A list of the drowned passengers and
crew was appended, and here Jacynth caught
sight of the name of Mme. de Vigny. “So she
went back to her old title, did she?” he mused.
“Well, one obstacle to Fenella’s happiness has
been removed now that that woman is dead.
Let us hope that she is dead indeed. It would
be no kindness to her or to others to hope for
her safety.”</p>

<p>His eye had fallen on a short paragraph, which
at first he had overlooked. Here it was stated
that three or four of the crew had managed, by
clinging to floating spars or other pieces of
wreckage, to come safe to land, and that it was
possible that more lives had been preserved in
this way, than could at present be ascertained.
There was no mention, however, of any woman
among the survivors: and, uncharitable as the
wish might sound, it must be confessed that
Jacynth heartily desired to be assured that Lucille
de Vigny would trouble no man’s peace
again.</p>

<p>The rest of the day dragged slowly by—slowly,
because he and Onslow were both fretting at the
delay caused by poor Ronny’s illness. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
were longing to reach the sunny shores of Guernsey,
to enter that rose-wreathed cottage, and to
pour their stories—each in his own way—into the
ears of the woman dearer to them than any other
in the world. And Onslow was not upheld by
the hope that Jacynth cherished—namely, that
Fenella, forgetting her past injuries in the love of
her child, would fly at once to nurse him, and to
clasp her newly-rescued husband in her arms.
Painful as this consummation might be to
Jacynth personally, he was unselfish enough to
rejoice in the prospect of Fenella’s future happiness,
but Lord Francis, who did not know of the
later telegram, grew irritable in his state of suspense
and anxiety, and would neither rest by day
nor sleep by night.</p>

<p>Jacynth had counted confidently on a return
telegram from Fenella as soon as possible, and he
was annoyed and disappointed when another day
dragged slowly by without any news of her.
Did she harbor so much resentment against Lord
Francis, that she would not even come to him
when their child was in danger? Jacynth’s anger
burned a little at the thought. He could not
believe that Fenella would be thus implacable.
And Ronny was distinctly worse, he was feverish,
and wandered in his talk, calling out for “Mummy”
and imploring to be taken away from Mrs.
Clutterbuck in a way that was pitiful to hear.
There were hints, too, of that darker time when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
he had been left alone with men and women of a
coarser type—brutes in human guise, who starved
and beat him and swore at him because he would
neither lie nor steal. This part of his story his
friends had striven to make him forget, but when
his brain was clouded by fever, the frightful
images of those terrible weeks in a New York
slum came back to him with redoubled force, and
it sometimes seemed as though only the presence
of the mother for whom he cried so constantly
could chase them away.</p>

<p>And yet Fenella did not come.</p>

<p>On the third day Jacynth waxed desperate,
and resolved to telegraph again. He had seen
in the newspapers some accounts of a gale which
had been raging in the Channel, and it occurred
to him that the Guernsey boats might perhaps
have ceased running, which would of course give
a reason for Fenella’s silence, and yet it seemed
to him impossible that she should have heard nothing
yet, or been unable to send him any answer.
He would telegraph again, but he would go to
Onslow first; it was possible—just possible—that
she might have written to <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>From the look of agitation on Frank’s face,
and the convulsive tightness with which he
grasped a letter in his hand, Jacynth fancied at
first that his conjecture had been correct.
“What is it?” he said hurriedly. “Your wife—is
she coming? Does she know that you are safe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“Heaven knows! She makes no sign. No,
the letter is not from her.”</p>

<p>His face was so pale, his aspect so disordered,
that Jacynth could only gaze at him in surprise.
And seeing his expression, Frank suddenly thrust
the letter into his hand.</p>

<p>“See there,” he said. “What does it mean?
Do you think there is anything in it? If it
should be true—of Fenella, my darling—what
have we done?” And he sank down in a chair
beside the table, and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Jacynth opened the letter, which was written
on coarse blue paper, and inclosed in a common
envelope. Outside it looked like a tradesman’s
circular. There was no stamp, no postmark; it
was simply superscribed with Onslow’s name, and
addressed to the hotel. The writing was evidently
disguised, many of the words were
printed, others written in a sloping hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will not tell you who I am,” the letter
began, “or you may not believe me; nevertheless,
I speak the truth. I am the only person,
except Lady Onslow, who can unravel the mystery
of Count de Mürger’s death. From her lips
you will never hear it; will you hear it from mine?</p>

<p>“She is innocent of his death; I can convince
you of that. She is screening another. Do you
not want to know his name? I was in the corridor
on the night when the murder took place; I
saw and heard all that occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“If you want to clear your wife’s name, come
at four o’clock this afternoon to No. 10 Pearson’s
Row, Mersey Street, then I will tell you all.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">One Who Knows the Truth.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The paper dropped from Jacynth’s hands. “If
Mme. de Vigny were living I should say that she
wrote this letter,” he remarked. “But how,” he
added, rather to himself than to Frank, “how
could she know?”</p>

<p>Onslow looked up. His face was haggard, and
there was a wild light in his eyes. “If she lives,”
he said brokenly, “she shall pay for all that she
has done——”</p>

<p>“There is no likelihood that she has been
saved,” Jacynth broke in. “I don’t think a single
woman was rescued. No, Frank, this is a plant;
and of course you will take no notice of it.”</p>

<p>“No notice of it! But do you think that I
would leave a stone unturned where Fenella’s
honor is in question?”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, don’t go,” cried Jacynth
hotly. “There can be no possible good in it.
What can there be for you to hear, unless you
doubt your wife’s story?”</p>

<p>His brow became dark and menacing as he
spoke, but he was more anxious than angry. He
and Fenella knew the truth, and he was bound by
her wishes to keep it secret from Lord Francis;
was it possible that anyone else should know?
Surely, he said to himself, no other soul on earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
now living had an inkling of the truth. But at
all hazards he would try to prevent Onslow from
keeping so suspicious and so unworthy a tryst.</p>

<p>Frank Onslow, however, had made up his
mind, and did not respond to any of Jacynth’s
somewhat ineffective arguments. And when the
clock struck three, he took up his hat and went
out without saying whither he was bound. But
Jacynth was only too certain that he had gone to
the place mentioned in the letter.</p>

<p>While he still stood hesitating whether to follow
and force his company on him whether he
would or no, there was a sound outside the door
which made him start—the rustle of a woman’s
dress, the well-known intonation of a woman’s
voice.</p>

<p>“My Ronny; is he here? And Frank—Frank?”</p>

<p>Fenella had arrived.</p>

<p>She came in, radiant with hope and joy, holding
out her hands to Jacynth, who came slowly
forward and clasped them in his own.</p>

<p>“My Ronny,” she repeated. “Ah, how happy
you have made me. I shall have both Ronny
and Frank again. Take me to them at once; I
cannot bear another instant of delay.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br>

BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mersey Street</span>, sir? Oh, yes; first to the
right, second to the left, and then third to the
right.”</p>

<p>Frank Onslow nodded his thanks and hurried
away, trying hard to retain the sequence of rights
and lefts in his confused brain; while the policeman
whom he had questioned stood looking after
him and beating his gloves.</p>

<p>“What does he want down Mersey Street? No
accounting for these swells.”</p>

<p>Onslow had not noticed the man’s manner, but
he could not help hesitating for a moment as he
reached the street named; and he hesitated again
as he paused at the open door of No. 10—open,
as he thought, like a trap.</p>

<p>But the intense desire to test the value of the
promised information bore down everything else;
and, forgetting the aspect of the coarse-looking
women and ruffianly men loafing about at public-house
doors and the corners of the streets, he
knocked sharply.</p>

<p>“I will not go in,” he said to himself. “Ronny—Fenella—my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
life may be of value to them, if it
is little to me.”</p>

<p>A hard faced, showily dressed woman of about
forty came to the door, looked him sharply up
and down, and before he could speak exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re the gent, are you?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Yes, I am the gentleman
who was to come here by appointment.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re too late,” said the woman sourly.
“She’s gone.”</p>

<p>“She—has—gone?” faltered Onslow. “The
appointment was at four o’clock. It is not ten
minutes past.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that. She came back in a hurry
in a cab, fetched her bag, and she’s gone.”</p>

<p>“But the—the lady—is coming back?”</p>

<p>“Not likely. If you came you was to be
shown into the room she took. Want to wait?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Onslow shortly, as a strange suspicion
flashed through his brain, and he turned and
hurried away.</p>

<p>Had Lucille been saved, and was this some
fresh scheme on her part, some fresh web spinning
to entangle him and keep him and Fenella
apart?</p>

<p>He shivered slightly as he walked sharply
away, feeling that he must by an accident have
escaped from some new peril; and as he walked
rapidly on through the crowded streets he saw
nothing but the face of his fair young wife gazing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
at him reproachfully, but with a yearning look of
forgiveness in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, there must be forgiveness now,” he muttered
feverishly; “I do not deserve it, but for
Ronny’s sake. And she is waiting for me—waiting
till I go to her and on my knees beg her to
come, and she will come, for the sake of our darling
boy.”</p>

<p>He was hurrying on with the busy tide of life
eddying by his side, but his eyes had once more
assumed their fixed, hypnotic look as he gazed
straight before him, seeing the chamber in which
his child lay dying, as it seemed, his little head
tossing from side to side, while his monotonous,
ceaseless cry was for his mother.</p>

<p>He had room but for one thought now, and
that was to fetch Fenella to her boy’s bedside;
and as the mental vision faded, and his countenance
resumed its wonted aspect, the influence
remained.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a few moments, thinking that
he would first return to the hotel, but feeling that
if the boy were worse he would not have the
strength of mind to leave him, he forced himself
in the other direction and made straight for the
great station.</p>

<p>“It was madness to expect her to come here,”
he kept on muttering. “It was my duty to fetch
her to our child.”</p>

<p>His actions were almost mechanical, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
throughout he felt as if some force other than his
own natural impulse was urging him on in all that
followed, though there seemed nothing unusual
in the aspect of the careworn man who spoke to
the inspector on the great platform, learned that
the next London express started in half an hour,
and then paced the flags slowly till he could take
a ticket and his place in a corner of one of the
coupés.</p>

<p>The rest was dreamlike, and there were times
when he became unconscious. It could hardly
be called sleep. And at those moments, mingled
with the rush and roar of the swift train, he could
hear Ronny’s plaintive cry for her who would
bring him back to life and health, while in the
faint distance, as if beckoning him onward, there
was Fenella’s sweet, half-reproachful face, waiting,
always waiting until he should come.</p>

<p>Ever the same, whether sunk in repose or
awake and staring out at the blurred landscape,
there was Fenella, with her great eyes, silently
calling him to her feet.</p>

<p>Yes, all dreamlike—visionary—of a great station,
of a short journey through the great city,
then of the rail once more, and then of the
steamer calmly gliding down Southampton
Water. The lights here and there, then the
darkness and the cool, soft, light breeze fanning
his burning temples, as he leaned over the bulwarks
forward with fixed eyes, waiting for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
morning and the first glimpse of the sunny island
which he loved.</p>

<p>Always confused and dreamlike, but there were
memories of the dancing waters, of dimly seen
white rocks, and of a great blaze of light flashing
out at intervals with electric glare, and seeming
to sweep the sea. Then a long, long period of
darkness in a rough, tossing sea, whose cool spray
ever dashed in his face, and at last a pale pearly
gray, changing to a warm glow; then broad sunshine,
and at last the rocky islets and his destination
looking a very paradise set in the deep blue sea.</p>

<p>The sight of the island gave him hope, and his
brain cleared for the time. He saw Fenella placing
her hands in his, eager to follow him to their
child, and for one moment he closed his eyes and
clung fast to the vessel’s side, for there was a sensation
of joy that turned him giddy. It seemed
greater than he could bear.</p>

<p>The port at last and the tedious landing, for it
was low water, but he sprang down into the first
boat that came alongside, and feeling calmer now,
he landed, but, as he stepped ashore, staggered
and nearly fell.</p>

<p>A curious feeling of irritation came over him
as he saw a man smile, and he turned upon him
resentfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t be cross, sir,” said the man. “You’re
not the first who has felt dizzy after being seasick.
You’ll be all right after breakfast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Breakfast!” The man’s words rang in his ears
and he remembered that it was many hours since
anything had passed his lips. But he thought no
more of his growing weakness, and had himself
driven to the rose-hung cottage where Fenella
was waiting for him with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>How long the time seemed, and how misty and
dim everything looked. The sun shone brilliantly,
but there was a something pressing, as it
were, upon his brain, a strange pain too at his
heart, and that feeling of faintness which seemed
to overcome him from time to time.</p>

<p>At last! The cottage where he had left her—his
darling—yes, the only woman he had ever
loved; and he sat up eager to spring out—to tell
her that his mission had been faithfully performed.
But he had to avail himself of the driver’s
arm and totter up to the door, his eyes wildly
searching the window for Fenella’s face.</p>

<p>Then once more, as in a dream, someone meeting
him and a voice speaking: “The lady? No,
sir, she left here in the bad weather, two days
ago, by the boat.”</p>

<p>Onslow heard no more, for a black cloud closed
him in, and when he recovered consciousness he
was looking in the pleasant face of the elderly
little doctor who had attended his wife.</p>

<p>“That’s better, my dear sir,” he said. “You
are suffering from exhaustion. That’s right—no,
no, you must drink this. You are not used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
the sea, I suppose. It does prostrate some people,
and leave them weak.”</p>

<p>“Mrs.—Lady Onslow—my wife?” gasped the
wretched man.</p>

<p>“She has left the island, my dear sir, and really
you must—— Good Heavens! what are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>“Return at once,” said Onslow, trying to rise.</p>

<p>“Impossible. You are not fit to travel.”</p>

<p>“Must travel.”</p>

<p>“But there is no boat till to-morrow morning
between nine and ten, and even if there were,
believe me, my dear sir, it would be madness. It
is my duty to tell you that you seem to me to be
developing symptoms that——”</p>

<p>The doctor said no more, for Frank Onslow
had sunk on the couch insensible once more, and
the next day’s boat had gone when, weak so that
he had to support himself with a stick, he made
his way slowly along the cliffs after dispatching a
telegram to Jacynth at the hotel at Liverpool
telling him of his state, of his failure, and imploring
him to send news.</p>

<p>He knew that it would be hours before an
answer could come, and to try and calm himself
he was slowly walking along the path, gazing out
to sea at the swiftly coming tide, and thinking of
the long period that had to be got over before
he could take boat the next morning, and escape
from what now seemed to him a prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>Sick at heart and angry at his weakness, he sat
down upon one of the blocks of stone that rose
from among the heather just as footsteps approached
from the direction in which he had
come, and a strange, foreign-looking man, thin,
ghastly, and whose ragged garments were hardly
hidden under a rough pea-jacket, looked at him
sharply as he passed, and raised his cap, showing
his closely cut hair.</p>

<p>Onslow acknowledged his salute, saw in him a
beggar, and his hand involuntarily went to his
pocket; but the man made a quick gesture, and
passed on.</p>

<p>“One as wretched, perhaps, as I,” thought Onslow;
and then, as if moved by some strange
impulse, he rose and followed the man, who
somehow had a strange fascination for him.</p>

<p>The path turned there, and the man disappeared
beyond a projecting rock, but reappeared, sheltering
behind the rock, as if to avoid being seen.</p>

<p>It was curious, but Onslow passed on, and left the
man bending downward, as if to fill a pipe. But
the man and his gestures passed out of Onslow’s
thoughts instantly, for, as he went on past the
rock in turn, he stopped short, paralyzed at the
sight of a well-dressed lady approaching him rapidly,
leaning down and talking to a little elfish,
sharp-faced peasant child, whom she was leading
by one hand, while she carried a small traveling
bag in the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Lucille!” gasped Onslow, as a great dread of
some fresh complication assailed him.</p>

<p>She started, drew herself up erect, and then,
with a look of wonder in her eyes which gave
place to a look of delight:</p>

<p>“Ah! <i>mon chéri</i>,” she cried. “Then you have
followed me?” Then to the wondering child,
“Go back to the cottage, <i>petite</i>. I do not want
you yet. I will fetch you soon. The little one
of an old friend, Frank,” she continued.</p>

<p>The handsome, smiling face suddenly turned
livid, the jaw dropped, and with her eyes dilated,
Lucille de Vigny stood gazing past Onslow as
if at some spectral object at his back. Then,
clutching the bag to her breast as if to protect
herself, she uttered a wild, animal-like cry of
dread, turned and dashed down among the rocks
where a precipitous track led to the sea.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment a hoarse voice
cried to Onslow in French:</p>

<p>“Take care! The poor child! Do not let her
see!”</p>

<p>But as the man literally plunged down the
track, the child uttered a piercing shriek, covered
her little face with her hands, and dropped down
upon her knees.</p>

<p>Onslow was paralyzed for the moment, and
then, as he heard another cry from below, he forgot
his weakness, a thrill of vigor ran through
him, and he staggered to the commencement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
the track. The woman was hateful to him now;
he had looked upon her as a serpent in his path,
but still she had loved him in her way. She was a
woman, and he could not stand supine and not raise
a hand to defend her from the attack of the savage-looking
wretch whose aspect had filled her with
such horror. He looked to right and left; there
was not a soul in sight, while at his feet the sea
came rushing and swirling in amid the wild, jagged
rocks, a wave every now and then rising up and
falling with a roar, scattering the spray high in air.</p>

<p>In his weak state it was madness to attempt
the descent, one at which he would have hesitated
even when well and strong, while now, as he lowered
himself down, clinging to rock after rock and
grasping at a handful of the tangled growth
among their interstices, he felt that the thrill of
strength was passing rapidly away.</p>

<p>But still he went on, with the thought in his
mind that even had Fenella been present, and
known of her enemy’s peril, she would have
urged him to try and save her from this man.</p>

<p>But now he felt that it could not be robbery;
it must be something more; and again, as from
below there arose a hoarse, despairing cry for
help, he asked himself, was this another of Lucille’s
victims, and—good Heavens! the thought
chilled him with horror. The man refused his
alms—he was no common beggar—did it mean
some terrible revenge?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>The idea thrilled him with another wave of
strength, and he went on lowering himself down,
feeling that those who had gone before must have
fallen. For there was no track now; he was on a
precipitous slope, where a false step would have
sent him headlong down to where the waves were
racing in among the broken crags of granite
crusted with limpet and barnacle, and amber,
clinging fucus, and among which every now and
then were the long strands of ruddy or olive sea-wrack
tossed here and there, like the shaggy hair
of strange sea monsters, coming in with the tide.</p>

<p>Onslow had lowered himself down till his
strength totally failed, and he sank upon a ledge,
giddy with weakness and excitement, as he
looked about him in vain for those he sought.</p>

<p>At that moment a huge wave broke with a
heavy, booming roar, and in the following noise
and rush of the waters, he lay down on his chest,
reaching out over the edge of the shelf to peer
below, for the chilling thought came upon him
now that both must have reached the bottom
and have been swept away.</p>

<p>A thrill ran through him again for there, not
thirty feet below him, in a complete <i>cul-de-sac</i>
among the rocks stood Lucille, her face toward
him, her wrist thrust through the handle of the
bag, and her fingers with her delicate gloves all
torn, cramped as it were into the rough rock on
either side, as, with her head thrown back and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
body bowed, she seemed to be at one and the
same time clinging desperately to the rock and
forcing herself as far back as she could from the
bareheaded man who stood a couple of paces
away, his arms crossed upon a breast-high stone
between them, and his chin upon them as he
gazed with a grim satisfaction at the terror-convulsed
face before him.</p>

<p>Onslow grasped the position, and he saw, too,
something glitter—it was the point of a knife
which appeared between the rock and the man’s
elbow.</p>

<p>“And I can do no more,” groaned Onslow to
himself.</p>

<p>At that moment he made an effort to try and
climb down, and a terrible spasm at his breast
made him sink down again, panting.</p>

<p>But his movement had caught Lucille’s eye,
and she glanced up wildly and uttered a shriek.</p>

<p>“Frank! Frank!” she cried; “help, help, he is
mad.”</p>

<p>The man looked up and uttered a loud laugh,
as he said calmly, in good English:</p>

<p>“No, monsieur, I am not mad. I am this
woman’s fate.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” shrieked Lucille, about whose feet
the waves were now surging, but she dared not
stir lest the man should spring upon her with
that knife. “Frank, for God’s sake, help! He
will kill me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>“Yes,” said the man, “as you killed me, body
and soul, and buried me in a dungeon that was
like a tomb.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” shrieked Lucille. “Help, Frank!
You loved me once.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” cried the man, unfolding his arms,
and glaring at Frank. “Another lover! Poor
wretch, I pity you. She has wrecked you as she
wrecked me.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried the wretched woman hoarsely.
“Help! help!”</p>

<p>“There is no help, woman,” thundered the
man. “The end has come. Monsieur, I claim
the right of punishment. I am her husband.
Bah! you can do nothing. It is her fate!”</p>

<p>“And so,” he continued, as he turned his terrible
eyes on the shrinking woman, “you saw me
away there yonder, and fled here. Fool! I knew
you would come here to steal away my little
Lucille—curse you! Why did I let her bear
your name? You would have stolen her away,
not that you loved her—you never loved, you
cannot—and it was to plant another sting, another
poisoned arrow in the breast of the poor
trusting wretch who loved you, idolized you, and
committed crime for your sake. But you could
not escape me longer. I followed you from
yonder town, I followed you step by step till I
have you here before me dying—do you hear,
wretch—dying before my eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“No, no, for pity’s sake!” she shrieked, her thin
voice hardly rising above the roar of the coming
tide. “Frank, call for help, he will murder me!”</p>

<p>“Yes—call, monsieur, call loud. There is none
to hear. No one can help her now. This is the
time for which I prayed in the cold, silent dungeon
at Clairvaux—for which I prayed as I toiled,
and it has come—come at last. Lucille, dearest
wife—ah, how beautiful you are—will you embrace
me once again? Thus, with the knife
between us, the hilt to my breast, the point to
thine? Shall we clasp each other in our arms
once more, or shall I wait and see the waves
slowly rise, and rise, and rise till they sweep
above your head?”</p>

<p>She uttered no sound now for the moment, but
kept her eyes fixed upon him, while Onslow
strove vainly to call for help—to go to the woman’s
aid, but every nerve seemed chained, and he
could only gaze down as the man glided round
the rock which parted him from his wife, holding
the knife-hilt against his breast.</p>

<p>Then, heard above the roar of the waves, Lucille’s
voice rang out inarticulately as she still
clung there, her back to the rock, her arms outstretched.
It was the cry of the rat driven to
the corner from which there is no escape, and in
his agony Onslow lay there, watching the <i>dénouement</i>
of the tragedy, perfectly helpless to save.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>

BY “TASMA.”</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> nineteenth century, as we are all aware, is
nothing if not analytical. Chemists spend days
and nights in examining into the properties of
some apparently unimportant compound, and do
not abandon their task until they have ascertained
the exact proportions in which primal gases are
blended in its composition. In the same way,
men of science, dissectors of motives, and these
curious lay-preachers, the French novelists, take
some complicated sentiment of the human heart
and twist it round, and turn it inside out, and
expend themselves in efforts to trace it back to
its origin through the influences of heredity or
idiosyncrasy, or a predominance of white or red
globules in the blood. Their researches are not
always as fertile in results as those of the chemists,
for in every human organization there enters
an unknown quantity which upsets the calculations
of all the physiologists and psychologists
combined. Nevertheless, they carry on their
labors undaunted, and it may be said of them, as
of the alchemists of old, that if they do not find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
the philosopher’s stone, they make at least occasional
discoveries which help to bring about a
better understanding of human needs and weaknesses.
It is unnecessary to say that the sentiment
of love, or the condition of a man or woman
under the influence of this sentiment, is the favorite
object of their investigations. And the more
it is entangled with other sentiments, such, for
instance, as those of duty or honor or pride or
passion, the better they are pleased; for, like the
chemists with their unknown compound, they can
give full vent to their analytical skill in pulling it
to pieces, and proving to their own satisfaction
that it is made up of all manner of minor mingled
sentiments, and is in fact nothing but a mere
jumble of inherited instincts and impulses.</p>

<p>The state of Jacynth’s mind, during his friend’s
absence upon his fruitless and bootless quest in
Guernsey, was just such as a scientific French
novelist would have loved to fathom and explain.</p>

<p>In so doing he would have performed a feat
of which the object of his investigation was himself
utterly incapable, for Jacynth, for reasons
best known to himself, shrank from making too
close an examination of his feelings and desires
at this particular period. It might have been
that he was afraid of facing the conclusion which
lurked at the bottom of them. There was a
small balcony at the Liverpool hotel, just outside
the room wherein Ronny was being coaxed into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
convalescence by his mother, where our hero
would sit smoking his cigar until late in the afternoon,
following out a train of disjointed thoughts
that he essayed to drive away upon the circling
wreaths of smoke drifting before him into the
void. Perhaps they were more impressions than
thoughts, half sad, half pleasant musings that it
was safer not to reduce to coherent shape. He
was conscious throughout of a dominant wish
that the present time could be prolonged into an
indefinite future; not at the cost of sickness and
suffering to his unfortunate friend, but only, perhaps,
at the cost of a timely prolongation of the
actual gales which prevented the Guernsey boats
from putting to sea. He had not willed that his
signature should appear upon the telegram to
Fenella in connection with her husband’s; but
since fate and (to say the truth) Frank’s folly in
running off upon a wild-goose chase of his own
had combined to leave him in charge, he could
not but feel that there was a certain poetical
justice in the situation, which it was allowable to
enjoy to the full while it lasted. He pondered a
good deal upon Fenella’s character, which seemed
to have revealed itself to him latterly in a new
light. He remembered that her first question,
her first cry, as she rushed into the hotel, had
been for her child. It was only afterward that
she had shown any solicitude concerning the fate
of Ronny’s father. Then, had she not resigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
herself to the lot—nay, had she not willfully
chosen it—of a self-constituted grass widow for
years unnumbered? Her child, however, she had
kept by her side, and, as far as could be seen, he
had satisfied all the needs of her heart, for
Jacynth was of those who believed that the train-attendant
of Fenella’s adorers had had nothing
to say to her heart, thought they might have
amused her vanity. Could she belong, he asked
himself, to the order of women of whom Dumas,
<i>fils</i>, speaks, when he says that in certain natures
the instinct of maternity overcomes the instinct
of wifehood, and that the woman ceases to be
wife and mother, and becomes mother and wife,
or possibly mother only? In that case any man
who should prove himself a true friend and protector
of her little boy might be sure of having a
warm second place in her heart. It was certainly
to be deplored that Ronny’s natural protector
was not better fitted for his responsible office.
Though Lord Onslow had shown spasmodic
bursts of affection for the lad and had undergone
in New York a useless martyrdom in his behalf,
which a man who, to speak familiarly, had kept
his head upon his shoulders, would have known
how to avoid, he had not been a father to him in
the true sense of the word. He had not once
essayed to reach the mother’s heart through the
child’s during all the years that he had been separated
from her. How differently Jacynth would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
have acted in his place; but then, as he reflected,
he would never have parted from Fenella at all.
He would have given her no reason, no excuse
for desiring to leave him, and as for those flirtations
of her juvenile matronhood, he would not
have taken them too seriously, for he would have
felt convinced that she would outgrow them—would
leave them behind, very likely, with the
cutting of her wisdom teeth. Well, life’s experience
had done for her what a husband’s guidance
had failed to do. She was amazingly reasonable
now, and might develop into a delightful
companion for a man of sense. It was a pity,
Jacynth thought again, but I do not believe he
avowed the thought, that Frank should have been
so wanting in this quality. A fine fellow without
doubt. A man to lead a forlorn hope in an
emergency, only forlorn hopes are unfortunately
rare as everyday occurrences. A grain of common
sense would have been much more to the
purpose, and this grain was unhappily just what
Fenella’s husband lacked. When his friend’s
deficiencies were not vaguely outlining themselves
upon the smoke-wreaths before him, the
recollection of a certain episode would take their
place, which never failed to bring a curious half
smile upon the smoker’s face, not a smile of the
lips, but an unconscious wrinkling of the skin in
the neighborhood of the eyes, which conveyed
the impression of some inward pleasure. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
episode had occurred the first morning that
Ronny had been well enough to be taken out in
a bath chair to Sefton Park, his mother and
Jacynth walking on either side. The little boy
had espied a sailor sitting on a bench with a
smoked-out pipe in his hand (lacking, perhaps,
the means of replenishing it), and having the
vision of his friend the bos’n before his eyes, and
a full comprehension, gathered from his night
upon the mast, of the dangers that lie in wait for
those who go down to the sea in ships, had asked
that his bath chair might be stopped, while he
pulled out his new purse and extracted one of
the sixpences his mother had put into it for the
tobaccoless sailor. The man’s gratitude had been
unbounded. He had taken off his hat to all the
group under the evident impression that it was a
family party, and “May all your progeny, sir, and
my lady’s, take after this ’ere little chap,” he had
said at parting, “it’s the best wish a grateful heart
can salute ye with.” Fenella had blushed a deep
rose color, and Jacynth had felt an unreasoning
pang of elation and regret as he walked away.
He would have liked to come across the sailor
again, not to correct him of his error, but to
reward him for it.</p>

<p>Another point connected with the present
aspect of affairs, which it was pleasant to be
reminded of, was the way in which Fenella
seemed to lean upon him. She would open the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
door that communicated with the balcony at all
hours of the day to ask him to decide this or that
question for her. Might not Ronny be “let off”
his tonic, which he hated, and have some roast
chicken? Did Mr. Jacynth think it would hurt
him to have his sofa wheeled on to the balcony—and
oh! would he mind just tasting the tiniest
drop of the new cough mixture, which was quite
a different color from the last, and telling her
whether he thought the apothecary might not
have made some mistake? And all these questions
Jacynth settled with a pseudo-marital
authority it was delightful to exercise. He unhesitatingly
prescribed roast chicken in the place
of the tonic; he wheeled Ronny’s sofa himself
on to the balcony; and he swallowed a whole
teaspoonful of magenta cough mixture without a
murmur, inwardly flattered that Fenella should
assign him the <i>rôle</i> of a slave of the worst of the
Roman Emperors (for was he not her slave in all
things). Her smile took away all the bitter
flavor from the drug, and the subsequent hours,
during which she sat by the side of Ronny’s sofa,
seemed to pass like a pleasant dream. What he
most enjoyed was the atmosphere of domestic
retirement and freedom that pervaded them.
Fenella would insist upon his continuing to
smoke his cigar, and so at home did he feel in her
presence that it had actually happened to him to
close his eyes behind <i>The Times</i> he was pretending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
to read, and to allow himself the full measure
of the traditional forty winks (though why forty
more than fifty or a hundred, I for one have
never been able to discover) before he opened
them again. Fenella, for her part, would remain
silent or speak, just as the spirit moved her.
Sometimes she would read a sentence out loud
from her book; an old copy of “Sartor Resartus”
as it happened, taken from the hotel library, and
ask him if he could make it clear for her. At
other times she would take no notice of his presence,
but would occupy herself entirely with
Ronny. Jacynth loved to watch her at these
moments from behind his paper, and seek fresh
proofs of the infinite variety of her charm. He
did not wonder that the little boy adored his
mother. She was his playmate and companion,
as well as his nurse and guardian. The stories
she told him, when he was tired of playing at
spilikins, with transparent little fingers that trembled
from weakness, were delightful. There was
always some point in them which provoked a
duet of laughter from both together, that Jacynth
found it good to listen to. There were times,
too, when the conversation would become general,
that is to say, when Ronny would be the chief
speaker, and when he would tell, in his quavering
little voice, of the wonderful and terrible things
he had seen in the New York slums. Jacynth,
moved with pity for the white terror portrayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
on Fenella’s face, would essay to divert his attention
to other topics. He could not, however,
prevent the child from narrating to his mother
the manner in which he had been ultimately
found and rescued. “They wouldn’t let me go
out of the room,” he said earnestly; “we was all
together in a room upstairs, oh, up such a lot of
stairs; Mick, that was the man’s name, and
Bridget and me. It was only one room, and that
was all our house; the other people only had one
room for all their house, too, and they gave me a
horrid old mattress in the corner to sleep on, and
I had no toys, not the least little bit of a toy to
play with, and I did get so tired all day long, and it
smelt so horrid in the room, you can’t think; and
one day Bridget thumped me on the head with a
plate—there was only two plates she had—and it
broke all to pieces; and I cried so, you can’t
think; I cried, and I cried, and I asked God to
send you to me, mummy; I went on asking Him
and begging Him all the time. But I don’t think
He heard me, for there was lots more rooms and
more ceilings; oh, ever so many over ours before
you got to the roof. And one day there was
someone knocked at the door; a great loud
knock, and Bridget called out, ‘There’s the black
man come for you; hide for your life, you spalpeen’—she
often called me a spalpeen—and I was
so frightened, I ran to my mattress, and Bridget
threw a horrid old dress over me and nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
smothered me. Mick wasn’t there, and what do
you think? When the men came in, I heard a
voice that wasn’t a bit like a black man’s voice.
I’d often heard the black men talking, you know.
There was a black butler where I was staying
before in New York, but this voice wasn’t a bit
like that; and so I just peeped, like this, from
under the clothes; and, oh, mummy, there was
Mr. Jacynth and a lot of policemen standing
inside the room, and I gave a great shriek—didn’t
I, Mr. Jacynth? and I kicked away the dress, and
I rushed right to where Mr. Jacynth was standing,
and I held to his legs—I did; and he took
me right up and kissed me. I put my arms
round his neck, and I cried and sobbed fit to
break my heart; and what do you think, mummy?
[Ronny’s voice conveyed unnumbered
notes of emphatic exclamation.] Mr. Jacynth
was crying, too; he was; <i>I seed him</i>.” He might
have added “as you are crying now, mother,” for
as the climax of the narrative was reached, Fenella
broke down completely, and instinctively
held out her hand to the savior of her little boy.
Jacynth could not refrain from pressing his lips
to it, and the action conveyed a thousand times
more than the courtly old custom is wont to convey
under ordinary circumstances. Ronny, overcome
by the recollections of the scene he had
conjured up, flung his arms round his mother’s
neck and then held up his face to Jacynth to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
kissed. “Let’s kiss altogether,” he said in the
effusiveness of the moment, and Fenella was fain
once more to turn away her head lest Jacynth
should see her blushes.</p>

<p>In connection with all this portion of the disastrous
chances that Ronny had experienced, it will
be noticed that no mention of his father crossed
his lips. It was only when the moving accident
on board the <i>Danic</i> was under discussion that
Frank’s share in the strange eventful history came
to be narrated, and even then, whether for the
reason that Jacynth’s presence recalled his behavior
on that dreadful night more strongly to
Ronny’s mind than that of his absent father, or
whether because his personality was in point of
fact so much the stronger of the two, it is certain
that the child persistently assigned the <i>rôle</i> of the
principal hero to his friend, notwithstanding the
well-intentioned efforts of the latter to transfer a
portion of his laurels to Lord Onslow. <i>Les absents
ont toujours tort</i>, says the French proverb,
and in a modified sense Ronny was unconsciously
proving the truth of the proverb.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that Fenella
neglected to inform herself in so far as was possible
of her husband’s movements. The telegram
from Guernsey had apprised her of his safe arrival,
and of his enforced detention through bad
weather. The three days’ gale had grown into a
five days’ gale, and every morning Jacynth notified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
to Lady Onslow, with an expression of becoming
gravity, the deplorable reports that had
reached him from the meteorological authorities;
and insisted upon the inadvisability of risking a
Channel crossing until the present tempestuous
winds should have abated. As Ronny was growing
hourly better, and had been promoted by the
doctor from roast chicken to mutton chops, and,
indeed, to “anything he fancied,” which was a
larger order perhaps than the worthy man could
have imagined, Lady Onslow accepted the delay
in her husband’s return with commendable philosophy.
I am not sure that she would have
shown equal resignation if there had been no one
at hand to participate in her delight at Ronny’s
recovery, but Jacynth’s interest in the event
seemed almost to equal her own, and his skillful
suggestion that the longer Frank remained away
the greater would be the joyful surprise that
awaited him, as regarded the amount of flesh that
Ronny would have put on during his absence,
seemed the best of reasons for taking patience.</p>

<p>It is an ill wind, says the old proverb, that blows
nobody any good. The wind that retarded the
Guernsey boats was blowing the roses into Ronny’s
cheeks and joy into Jacynth’s heart, when it
suddenly lifted and a great calm fell upon land
and sea. Looking from the balcony Fenella saw
the lake in the opposite park shining in the distance
like a silver shield, and reflected that at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
same time next evening she would probably
be watching it with her husband by her side.
Ronny was now running about in the full exercise
of a convalescent’s privileges, and tyrannizing
over his mother and his friend upon the principle
that he was to live at his ease, to do as he
pleased, and “not to be worried, the doctor says.”
With the recuperative force of childhood he
seemed hourly to grow and expand, and many
were the conversations that Fenella had with
Jacynth upon the subject of his future training.
She noticed that a word from the latter went
farther than a whole chapter of expostulations
from herself, and fell unconsciously into the
habit of referring the little boy to his friend upon
every occasion. It may be that, as she watched
the sky this evening, she was wondering what
Ronny would do when the firm and gentle influence
that was so beneficial to him was removed;
and altogether so absorbed was she in her
thoughts that she did not even hear Jacynth’s
step approaching until he was by her side. Then
she turned her face, transfigured by the sunlight
glow, and looked at him with questioning eyes.
Jacynth’s face was very grave; there was bad
news written in every line. He held a telegram
in his hand, and Fenella, with a sudden sense of
icy chilliness invading her forehead and cheeks,
took it from him without a word. Jacynth, seeing
her so white, thought she was about to faint,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
and forced her gently back into a chair. The
telegram was brief, as telegrams are wont to be,
even when infinite joy and sorrow are compressed
into them. “Lord Onslow seriously ill,”
it said. “Advise Lady Onslow to come at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why,” was Fenella’s first thought, “had
she not gone sooner? Why had she allowed
herself to take it for granted that the winds and
the waves were the cause of the long delay?
Might not her heart have told her that some
stronger power than those was holding her husband
back? Had she even once taken the trouble
to verify for herself the list of the arrivals and
departures on the Guernsey boats. What selfishness,
what apathy, what <i>indifference</i>, alas! she
had been guilty of.” These were the self-upbraidings
that pursued her all the time she was
making her hurried and eager preparations for
departure. Jacynth had essayed, in his usual
calm and kindly fashion, to reassure her against
her worst fears, but he could not enter into the
subtler causes of her remorse. Ronny, in morbid
terror of being taken to sea again, behaved,
nevertheless, like a man, when Jacynth showed
him that it was his duty to take care of his
mother. That very night he, Fenella, and the
child, who were so used by this time to passing
for Monsieur, Madame, et Bébé that they almost
felt like the personages they simulated, left Liverpool
for London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>A privilege children share with animals is their
inability to realize the meaning of sickness and
sorrow, or suffering, at a distance. Though
Ronny knew that he was being taken to see
“Poor papa, who was ill,” the knowledge did not
bring home to him in any way the fact that he
was in danger of losing his father. Fenella’s
prescience was keener; the words “seriously ill”
pursued her like a maddening refrain throughout
the whole long journey. In vain Jacynth represented
to her that “seriously” did not signify the
same thing as “dangerously.” For the first time
since he had known her, she showed a disposition
to resent his consolatory speeches. On the
steamer she hid herself away in the ladies’ cabin,
a proceeding which Jacynth knew to be contrary
to all her instincts, and left him to smoke his
cigar forlornly on the deck. She would not even
give him the solace of taking charge of Ronny,
but carried the little boy below into the petticoat
atmosphere of the unwholesome stronghold she
had selected. Jacynth therefore battled with his
thoughts alone. He was better able than Ronny
to realize the import of the telegram which had
summoned him to Guernsey, and it must be admitted
that he did his utmost to bring himself to
hope that the issue would be such as his conscience
and his sense of honor demanded that he
should hope; for the consideration that Frank’s
death would transform the “might have been”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
into the “might be” was one that he strove manfully
to put away. It must not be as a Judas, he
told himself, that he approached the bedside of
his friend, sick, perhaps, unto death at this very
moment.</p>

<p>Aye! sick unto death, though even the doctor
who attended poor stricken Frank would have
told you there was hope still. What did the
doctor know of the last terrible scene in a life’s
tragedy to which his patient had been a helpless
witness, before he dragged himself back, quaking
with fever and affright, to the cottage wherein he
had taken up his temporary abode? What if the
love that had linked him for a space with Lucille
de Vigny had had little in common with the
“holy flame that forever burneth”? What if it
had been nothing but the evanescent and unholy
outcome of “fantasy’s hot fire”? It had yet left
a recollection behind it which rendered it more
terrible for him to see her tortured and slain than
another and a better woman. That second during
which the lunatic’s knife had been pressed
against her heart, the second during which she
had shrieked aloud to him for help, a hideous,
unmelodious shriek, more like a squall of far-gone
animalish agony than a woman’s shriek, had
utterly unmanned him. He had realized in that
short space all the horrors of a Dantesque hell
whence rescue is impossible. Yielding to the
mad impulse of the moment, he would have flung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
himself down from the rock, a useless victim, had
not the mighty ocean, or possibly some stronger
power still, taken the matter into its hands and
rendered all intervention useless. Frank was
conscious of a loud booming noise accompanied
by a mighty swish and whirl of water that seemed
to cover the whole tragic scene from his view.
The salt spray dashed aloft and closed his smarting
eyes. When he opened them again, Lucille
and her husband were gone, only a monster wave
curling back into the ocean was sounding their
dirge. Whether the knife had entered her heart
before the sea took her into its merciful embrace,
whether in her death struggle she had clutched at
her murderer and dragged him down with her to
her doom, whether some mighty wave had risen
unexpectedly and swept both combatants away
at the same instant, could never be known. The
ocean seemed to be lashed into a sudden fury.
For a moment Frank dimly discerned some object
that might have been a woman’s hair floating
under the liquid green. But was it Lucille’s hair?
For all he knew it might have been only one of
those waving tangles of brown seaweed that the
mighty Atlantic surges wash into the English
Channel. With trembling knees and a reeling
brain he staggered away from the scene of the
tragedy. It was fully two hours before he succeeded
in dragging himself back to the cottage,
where he terrified the inmates by the aspect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
his drawn white face and hollow eyes. What had
become of Lucille’s sobbing child, orphaned, in
one short, fateful instant, he could not have told.
Tended and put to bed by kindly hands, he lay
like the Israelitish king with his face to the wall,
in the torpor that followed upon the too great
tension he had endured. Even the zest for life
seemed to be leaving him. There was only one
thing left, for which he would fain have endured
a few hours longer, and no one could give him the
assurance that this thing he yearned for was coming
close and closer to him with every vibration
of the screw that drove the Guernsey boat with
its freight of passengers nearer and nearer to its
destination.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.<br>

BY F. ANSTEY.<br>
<br>
<small>“WHOM THE GODS HATE DIE HARD.”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seemed that the doctor was right after all;
Frank Onslow was feeling better, distinctly, undeniably
better, as he lay on the chintz couch in the
little sitting room of the rose-hung cottage at
Guernsey. The pain about the region of the
heart had entirely disappeared under skilled medical
treatment; not for many a day had he felt
more vigorous and hopeful, reclining there with
his eyes fixed upon the door in momentary
expectation that it would open and admit the
slight girlish form of the wife from whom he had
been so long and cruelly separated. Yes, Fenella
was on her way to him, he would see her, hold
her in his arms! There might be years of happiness
yet in store for them—in which to
atone, to forget. Surely the boat must have
arrived by this time! What was that sound?
He had not deceived himself; there <i>was</i> a light
step on the gravel outside. She had come, she
was here, in another instant she would be at his
side! The door was gently opened, he rose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
his feet with a smothered cry of joy, rose—and
the next instant sat down again heavily, with a
groan of irrepressible disappointment. For the
woman who stood there, dazzling yet in her faded
southern beauty, was not Fenella; it was Lucille
de Vigny, whom, as he fondly imagined, he had
last beheld drowning in the blue-green waves,
clasped in the fierce embrace of her injured and
revengeful husband, the blade of whose dagger
was deeply embedded in her bosom.</p>

<p>The shock of the surprise was considerable; it
was some time before he could recover sufficiently
to express himself in appropriate terms.</p>

<p>“Witch, demoness, arch-fiend that you are!”
he groaned, “how came you here? Has the sea
given you up once more?”</p>

<p>“Ah, Frank!” she said, with a soft musical
accent of reproach, “I did not expect that question
(to say nothing of the form in which it was
put) from you of <i>all</i> men. Who should know
how I escaped what seemed a well-nigh inevitable
doom, if not the man who preserved my life?”</p>

<p>“I—<i>I</i> preserve your life?” gasped Onslow, in a
bewilderment which, under the circumstances,
was not unnatural.</p>

<p>“You forgot soon, sooner than I. I can see
the whole scene yet; my horrible husband holding
me closer, closer still; the steely glitter of the
blade as it touched my breast; you on the rock
thirty feet above, gazing with eyes that are fixed—oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
but fixed! [she closed her own as she
spoke, with a flicker like the instantaneous shutter
of a camera] and next, without warning, with
a sudden bound you leapt the distance between
us, hurled, with a strength that in your shattered
state seemed almost supernatural, my would-be
executioner into the sea with one hand, while you
supported my half-fainting form with the other,
and then strode away up the cliff like one in a
dream. Surely you remember?”</p>

<p>Frank shook his head; he had no recollection
whatever of the incident. That this should be so
will not surprise the reader, who is already aware
that he was subject, under certain mental conditions,
to hypnotic trances. In one of them he
had, as we know, destroyed a life; in another he
had preserved one—with an equal lack of volition
of consciousness in either case. Even now he
could not bring himself to credit her account,
any more than he could affect a decent degree of
satisfaction at so untimely a resuscitation.</p>

<p>Still, there she stood, alive—whoever had rescued
her; and it occurred to him presently that
he might at least profit by the fact to obtain
some light upon a point which had cost him several
anxious thoughts of late. Had she, or had
she not, written that mysterious letter from Pearson’s
Row? If she had, could she indeed prove
that Fenella was guiltless of Count de Mürger’s
blood?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Despite his intrinsic loyalty to his wife, he
could not help preferring that her fair little hand
should be unstained even by a justifiable homicide.
It was weakness, no doubt, but man is
built up of prejudices which can neither be defended
nor overcome.</p>

<p>“Lucille,” he said brokenly, “you have not
treated me altogether well; you have done your
best to keep my wife and me apart; you have
wantonly abducted my only son, my little Ronny;
you have had me shut up in a lunatic asylum; I
strongly suspect that you know more than you
should about the fire which occasioned the total
loss of the <i>Danic</i>, and all but a small percentage
of her crew and passengers—and yet—and yet,
Lucille, I cannot but think that you still retain a
lingering spark of true womanliness somewhere,
in spite of all! By that spark, I adjure you
solemnly, to tell me, as you hope for mercy,
whether you did or did not write that letter
signed ‘One who knows the truth’?”</p>

<p>“I did,” she answered, “I <i>do</i> know it. I have
come here with the full intention of telling it.”</p>

<p>“And you can clear Fenella?” asked Frank.
“Then I forgive you freely all the wrong you
have done—only speak, Lucille, tell me all at
once, keep me no longer in suspense!”</p>

<p>“Wait,” she said calmly and almost soothingly,
“are you quite sure that you can bear to know
the truth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“Sure?” he exclaimed, “if only Fenella did not
stab the count, what care I what other hand dealt
the fatal blow?”</p>

<p>Lucille de Vigny smiled, a dark and mystic
smile, as she said slowly, “Not even if the hand
should prove to be <i>your own</i>?”</p>

<p>Frank Onslow fell back with blue and writhing
lips. “It is a lie,” he said hoarsely, “a cruel
lie!”</p>

<p>“It is the truth, my poor Frank; I can prove it.”</p>

<p>Now, as has been already stated, this was mere
conjecture on her part. In spite of the assertion
in her letter, she had <i>not</i> been in the corridor of
the Prospect Hotel when the tragic occurrence
had taken place. On the contrary, she had been,
perhaps, the most perplexed by Frank’s disappearance
the next morning. It was only subsequently
that her feminine intuition had supplied
a partial solution of the mystery. However, her
shot told with terrible effect.</p>

<p>“Prove it!” he repeated incredulously. “Why,
after I had seen the count enter Fenella’s room,
I went straight to my own; I sat up in a stupor
till daylight, I did indeed, Lucille!”</p>

<p>“And at daylight you fled,” said Mme. de
Vigny softly.</p>

<p>“Only as far as Paris,” he rejoined, “and I did
not fly. I traveled in my ordinary manner.”</p>

<p>“At least you left your wife to go through the
inquest and trial alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“I did not know of either until weeks afterward,
when Castleton showed me the reports.”</p>

<p>“Not know of a sensation that was convulsing
all England? Paris is scarcely Kamschatka, my
dear Frank. English papers are procurable at
the hotels.”</p>

<p>“I—I was ill,” he said feebly, “or else I was
yachting for weeks in the Bay of Biscay. Or
both—<i>I</i> don’t know!” Even to his sick and bewildered
brain his story began to seem rather a
lame and unprofitable one. “But my wife,”
urged the wretched Frank, with a pitiful return
of hopefulness, “expressly admitted, when she
was examined and cross-examined on her trial,
that she had done the deed herself in defense of
her life. I have never yet known Fenella, with
all her faults, stoop to a direct falsehood. How
do you get over <i>that</i>, Lucille?”</p>

<p>“I am a foreigner,” was the chilling response,
“and, as such, imperfectly acquainted with your
criminal procedure. Still, I have always understood
that persons indicted for such offenses are
not entitled to give evidence in their own defense.
I may be wrong.”</p>

<p>It should be explained here that Mme. de
Vigny <i>was</i> wrong—or partly so. There certainly
is some such rule, but it would be strange, indeed,
if an advocate of Clitheroe Jacynth’s position and
influence could not succeed in getting it set aside
in favor of his fair client, when, as his legal acumen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
had divined, the effect of such an admission
would inevitably insure the prisoner’s triumphant
release, even on a trial for manslaughter.
And the result, as has been stated, amply justified
his calculations.</p>

<p>But the diabolical plausibility of Lucille’s rejoinder
destroyed the last vestige of hope for
Frank, who was less familiar with the laws of his
country than every well-educated Briton should
be.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he groaned, “I did it—I <i>must</i>
have done it. And—what on earth shall I do
<i>now</i>, Lucille?”</p>

<p>Her face, past its first youth as it was, became
rapt and transfigured with tenderness as she bent
over him and laid one slight burning hand on
each of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” she said, in her low, cooing
accents; “if you stay here, you are lost! For
after your rash visit to Inspector Brown at Scotland
Yard, nay, before that, the detectives have
been upon your track. It cannot be many years,
or months, perhaps, before they hunt you down,
even in such a remote island as Guernsey. And
if you are arrested and brought to trial, Fenella
will be powerless to screen you any longer. As
your wife she will be unable to give her testimony
in your behalf, as you are doubtless aware.
I alone know your guilt, but do you think that I
would betray you? Why, I love you, Frank; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
think I have always loved you, even when I
seemed to hate you most. And now that you
have saved me from a hideous death, oh! my
dear, my dear, how can I give you up? No, fly
with me at once. We will go to South Africa,
where society is freer and healthier than here,
and conventional prejudices do not exist. Come,
Frank, come ere it is too late.”</p>

<p>The miserable man wavered on the couch; he
did not love this woman, not at least with any
passion deserving the name, but he was in her
power. And how, how could he face his lovely
innocent Fenella with the consciousness that he
was a murderer?</p>

<p>As he still hesitated, there came a resounding
knock at the trellised door which made them both
start. “The detectives!” whispered Lucille de
Vigny, “<i>already</i>; quick, Frank, the back door.”
But Frank Onslow had not lost all his manliness;
he drew himself to his full height with a proud
dignity. “Back doors are not exactly in my way,
Lucille,” he said, “let them take me. I am
ready to atone with the last remnant of my miserable,
ill-spent life.” And the door flew open as
he spoke—but it was no detective that entered.</p>

<p>Fenella came in in her pretty light frock, her
small cheeks flushed with a now unaccustomed
rose tint, and something of the old, merry, mischievous
sparkle in her tan-colored hazel eyes,
for she had been laughing and talking on the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
up with Jacynth, and telling him how she had
fascinated the steward of the steamer, until, with
her customary light-heartedness, she had almost
forgotten the gravity of the errand on which she
came. Jacynth’s dark, clean-shaven face, with
the imperturbable expression and the firmly
molded jaw, was visible over her slim shoulder.</p>

<p>But, at the sight of Mme. de Vigny, her old
enemy and rival, all the merriment and infantile
innocence in Fenella’s lovely audacious face
faded suddenly; her tawny eyes flashed with the
tigerish gleam Frank remembered so well, her
soft red mouth grew hard and set. “I perceive,”
she said icily, “that I am <i>de trop</i>. I was not
aware that you were well enough to receive a
<i>visitor</i>, Lord Francis. Mr. Jacynth, will you
please take me away?”</p>

<p>“Fenella!” cried Frank in an agony. “Let
me explain! This, this she-fiend, this mocking
devil has come to try and persuade me that it was
I—<i>I</i> who stabbed Count de Mürger with my own
hand! Tell me, for pity’s sake, that you at least
do not believe it!”</p>

<p>“For once in her life,” said Fenella, with a
touch of her old airy impertinence, “Mme. de
Vigny has spoken the truth. My dear Frank, I
would willingly oblige you if possible, but I cannot.
I <i>saw</i> you do it with my own eyes!”</p>

<p>The unhappy Frank staggered at these terrible
words. “My own wife! <i>She</i> says she saw me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
do this thing! How you must <i>loathe</i> me, Fenella!
<i>How</i> you must loathe me!”</p>

<p>“But I <i>don’t</i>, Frank,” she assured him earnestly.
“I don’t loathe you in the least, you poor unhappy
boy! Because—oh, listen, Frank—when
you killed him, I knew from your expression that
you were in a hypnotic trance, and, therefore,
neither morally nor legally responsible for your
actions!”</p>

<p>Frank wiped his brow; an immense load was
lifted from his soul. “That accounts for it,” he
said slowly, “I felt sure I could not have committed
such an act in an ordinary state without
retaining <i>some</i> recollection of the circumstance.
And yet,” he added moodily, “if I am accused,
who can prove that I did it in this unconscious
state? Not you, Fenella; according to Mme. de
Vigny, at least.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Lucille, speaking for the first
time. “You are his wife, Lady Francis, and the
law will not accept you as a witness. There is no
one who can prove it, and therefore, the deduction
I leave to you.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Jacynth, stepping calmly
forward. “There <i>is</i> somebody—Lord Castleton.
He has lately told me so. It appears, my dear
Onslow, that he saw you subsequently, when you
were suffering from a precisely similar attack.
You stabbed madly, blindly, without being in the
least aware of your actions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“<i>Another</i> murder?” cried the horrified Frank.
“Oh, the horror, the black, hopeless horror of it!
To be doomed to these deeds of blood, and never
to suspect it till too late. Jacynth, I think I shall
go mad.”</p>

<p>“There is no necessity, my dear boy,” said the
barrister kindly. “Fortunately, on this particular
occasion you were armed with no more formidable
weapon than a roll of paper, or else, had
there been a victim at hand, which providentially
there was not, the consequences might indeed
have been disastrous.”</p>

<p>Frank’s countenance cleared once more; he
could embrace his wife now with a clear conscience,
and accordingly he turned with extended
arms. “Fenella,” he cried, “<i>Mrs. Right!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Doggie, my own Doggie!</i>” was the ringing
response, and the pair were folded in one another’s
arms. Jacynth had turned away. Pardon
him, reader, if at that supreme moment of reconciliation
his own heart was too sore and bitter to
bear the sight of the happiness which had been
mainly his own work. Devoted friend, self-contained,
distinguished barrister as he was, he
was still many removes from an angel. But the
sound of the old pet names, the names she remembered
on the envelope returned to Chiddingford
from the Dead Letter Office, seemed to
exasperate Lucille de Vigny to a fury that would
not have disgraced a fiend. It must be remembered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
in justice to her, that she had loved this
man with all the ardor of a passionate, undisciplined
nature, she had lost him, had been on
the verge of recapturing him, and now he had
escaped her once more, and something told her
that this time it was forever!</p>

<p>“Very pretty, my faith!” she said, with a bitter
laugh of mingled rage and despair. “<i>Quelle
innocence, mon Dieu!</i> You have defenders—is it
not?—who combine military duties with a naval
footing? How do you call them, <i>hein</i>? I
forget.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, madame,” suggested Jacynth
gravely, “you refer to the Marines?”</p>

<p>“The Marines—it is that, yes. Well, tell this
fine story to them—to your Marines. Or, better
still, for I hear them, they are here at last, to
your detectives, and see what they will say to
you!” Her fine instinct had not deceived her
this time; almost before she had finished speaking
a couple of men in plain clothes came into
the room. They had the sharp, roving eye of the
trained sleuthhound, and one of them carried a
pair of steel handcuffs.</p>

<p>“There is the man you seek,” cried Lucille,
pointing to Frank, who stood quietly awaiting his
captors in the center of the room. “Ah, my poor
Doggie, you have had your day!”</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, madame,” said one of
the men, not uncivilly, slipping the handcuffs over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
Lucille’s slender wrists, “but <i>you’re</i> the party
we’re after. You have given us the slip often
enough, but I think we’ve got you safe this
time.”</p>

<p>Mme. de Vigny’s face changed; for an instant
she seemed to contemplate resistance, and then
she submitted to the inevitable, and followed
her captors to the door. On the threshold she
paused and looked back with a gaze of concentrated
hate upon the party. “Bah!” she ejaculated,
and then, with an indescribable gesture of
defiant contempt, she walked out of the room,
and out of the lives her baleful influence had done
so much to perturb.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone, Frank, with a sudden
recollection, inquired, “And the boy, our Ronny,
Fenella? He is not ill—not <i>again</i>? Tell me the
worst. I—I can bear it!”</p>

<p>“Ronny,” said Fenella, with one of her little
spasms of silent mirth, “Ronny is quite well;
only he insisted in driving up to the door in a
goat chaise. What is the matter, Frank—you
are not unwell?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank faintly, “no, only the dread
of some new disaster. We have gone through so
many!”</p>

<p>“They are all over now,” she said, sweetly and
confidently, “all over. Ronny will be here soon,
and then we three will live here happily together,
and poor Mr. Jacynth, whose time I am afraid I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
have really monopolized quite shamefully, can go
back to his chambers and his clients again.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jacynth dully. “I can go back. I—I
have neglected them too long.”</p>

<p>It was the end, he realized; she needed him no
longer. He should see her no more—he would
go. But before he could carry out his intention,
he was startled by a sudden change in Onslow’s
expression and, shocked beyond words, he saw
him throw his arms above his head, turn sharply
round three times, and totter heavily against a
wire flower stand, full of hyacinths in bloom,
which he brought down with him in his fall. It
was all over! The long-standing heart trouble,
combined with the excitement of the varied
events of the past months, and especially of the
last hour, had brought poor Frank Onslow’s
checkered career to a sudden and tragic close,
and the form that lay there among the bared
bulbs, crushed bells, scattered earth, and broken
pots of the hyacinths was already itself nothing
but lifeless clay.</p>

<p>Fenella felt too much for tears; she stood
there in a kind of stupor, wondering what had
happened to her, and how it would affect her
when she was able to think of it. It was Jacynth
who, with his never-failing tact and consideration,
came to her relief.</p>

<p>“This is no place for you now,” he said, in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
grave, gentle tones. “Let me lead you away,
Fenella.”</p>

<p>Fenella allowed herself to be guided by him;
she had got so much into the habit of depending
entirely upon him lately that somehow it seemed
the natural thing to do. Only when they reached
the fresh air and sunshine outside she looked up
at him with childlike, appealing eyes. “Where
are we going?” she inquired dreamily.</p>

<p>“We are going,” he said, “to meet Ronny and
the goat chaise.”</p>

<p>It was strange, perhaps, but this simple remark
gave Fenella a vague comfort. It would be some
time—weeks, or even months—she knew, before
happiness returned to her, and she was her own
wayward, light-hearted self again; but that happiness
was in store for her, that some day, sooner
or later, she would forget all that seemed so painful
and unpleasant just now, she knew as surely
as that she was walking down the road, and
leaning upon Clitheroe Jacynth’s strong right
arm.</p>

<p>And so these two went down to meet the goat
chaise.</p>
